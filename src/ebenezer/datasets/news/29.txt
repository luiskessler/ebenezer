# Japan's Ruling Coalition Loses Upper House Majority as Rural Discontent and Rice Crisis Fuel Historic By-Election Losses

**TOKYO, Feb. 21** — Japan's Liberal Democratic Party and its junior coalition partner Komeito suffered a combined loss of nine upper house seats in by-elections held across fourteen prefectures on Sunday, results confirmed by the election commission on Friday after delayed counting in three rural constituencies, stripping the ruling coalition of its majority in the House of Councillors for the first time since 2007 and dealing Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba a political blow of sufficient severity that three senior LDP faction leaders were reported by Friday afternoon to be privately circulating the view that his leadership of the party could not survive beyond the LDP's scheduled presidential review in September.

The by-elections, triggered by a combination of resignations and deaths among sitting councillors, were fought in an atmosphere of unusually sharp public anger driven by a confluence of economic grievances that political analysts described as the most potent combination of rural and urban discontent the LDP had faced in a generation: rice prices that have risen 68 percent over the past twelve months following successive harvest shortfalls driven by the hottest summers in recorded Japanese history, a political finance scandal whose dimensions have continued to expand despite the partial accountability measures the Ishiba government pursued after taking office in October 2024, and a growing sense in regional Japan that Tokyo's economic policies have deepened rather than addressed the structural decline of rural communities whose populations have contracted steadily for four decades.

"What happened on Sunday was not a protest vote in the conventional sense," said Koichi Nakano, a professor of political science at Sophia University in Tokyo, in an interview on Friday. "This was a fundamental withdrawal of consent by communities that have supported the LDP through thick and thin for sixty years and have concluded, with something approaching finality, that the party no longer governs in their interest."

The rice crisis has been the most viscerally felt element of public discontent. Japan has experienced two consecutive years of below-average rice harvests — the staple crop's production is acutely sensitive to the extreme summer heat events that have become significantly more frequent — and the government's management of its strategic rice reserve has been the subject of intense criticism after an Agriculture Ministry release of reserve stocks in September proved insufficient to stabilise prices and was followed by revelations that reserve levels had been allowed to fall to their lowest point since the reserve system was established in 1995. Rice, which carries deep cultural as well as nutritional significance in Japan, has become the symbolic centre of a broader argument about food security, agricultural policy, and the state's capacity to protect its citizens from the consequences of climate-driven disruption.

Agriculture Minister Taku Eto had been expected to announce a further emergency reserve release this week but instead resigned on Thursday following the publication of a recording in which he appeared to joke at a private dinner that he had "never had to buy rice myself because supporters give it to me" — a remark whose tone-deafness in the current environment produced what political observers described as one of the fastest political careers endings in recent Japanese parliamentary history. Ishiba accepted the resignation within four hours and expressed "deep apology" to the Japanese public, his third such apology on rice-related matters in as many months.

The opposition bloc, led by the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan under leader Yoshihiko Noda, gained five of the nine seats lost by the coalition, with two additional seats going to Nippon Ishin no Kai and two to an independent candidate running on an explicitly anti-LDP agricultural reform platform in Niigata prefecture — Japan's largest rice-producing region — who defeated a five-term incumbent with a margin that prefecture officials described as unprecedented in their records.

Noda struck a carefully calibrated tone at a press conference in Tokyo on Friday, avoiding triumphalism while making clear the CDP intended to use its new leverage in the upper house aggressively. "The Japanese people have sent a message that requires no interpretation," he said. "They want a government that protects their livelihoods and is held to account for its failures. We intend to be a parliament that enforces both of those demands."

The loss of the upper house majority does not immediately threaten the government's survival — Japan's constitution gives the lower house primacy on budget and treaty matters, and the LDP retains its lower house majority from the October 2024 general election — but it significantly complicates the government's legislative programme and creates what constitutional scholars describe as a potential "twisted parliament" dynamic whose last significant manifestation, under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in 2007, contributed directly to his first resignation. Legislation that requires upper house approval, including several elements of Ishiba's proposed agricultural reform package and a planned revision of the immigration control act, now faces uncertain passage.

The political finance scandal that has shadowed the LDP since late 2023, involving the systematic non-disclosure of political fundraising dinner revenues across multiple LDP factions, has not been fully resolved despite the expulsion of several implicated members and the disbandment of the most heavily involved factions. A special prosecutor's office investigation, which concluded last year without charging senior LDP figures who opposition parties argue bore clear political responsibility for the scheme, has left a residue of public scepticism about accountability that Friday's results suggest has hardened rather than dissipated.

A senior LDP official, speaking without authorisation because internal discussions about the party's response to the results are ongoing, said the leadership was "not yet in crisis management mode but was approaching it." The official described Friday's internal atmosphere as "the quietest kind of anger — the kind where people have stopped arguing because they have started calculating." The calculation being made, the official said, involved whether an early lower house dissolution and general election — which Ishiba could theoretically call to seek a fresh mandate — would produce better or worse outcomes than allowing the current legislature to run toward its 2028 scheduled expiry.

Japan's external economic environment provides limited political cushion. The yen has appreciated sharply since December, reaching 138 to the dollar on Friday — a level that benefits consumers through lower import prices but that has squeezed exporters whose earnings translate back into yen at less favourable rates. The Bank of Japan, which raised its benchmark rate to 0.75 percent in January in continuation of its gradual policy normalisation, has signalled further tightening contingent on inflation and wage data, a trajectory that some LDP economists argue risks premature economic tightening at a moment of political fragility.

The government's relationship with Washington has added a further complication. US trade pressure on Japan — including demands for further reductions in automobile tariffs and for greater Japanese defence spending contributions — has been a persistent irritant, and Ishiba's scheduled bilateral meeting with President Trump in Washington next month now carries greater political risk than it did before Sunday's results. A weakened prime minister seeking a domestic political win may feel pressure to offer concessions that a stronger counterpart could have resisted, a dynamic that Japanese trade ministry officials have privately flagged as a concern in preparatory discussions.

In rural Japan, where Sunday's electoral revolt was most acute, the mood on Friday was described by local journalists and community leaders as one of grim satisfaction rather than celebration. The region's problems — declining population, ageing infrastructure, hollowed-out local economies, agricultural sectors under pressure from both climate disruption and decades of urban-favouring policy — will not be resolved by a by-election result, however historic.

"We did what we could do," said a local farmers' cooperative chairman in Niigata, reached by telephone on Friday and speaking on condition that his name not be used. "Whether anyone in Tokyo actually changes anything — that is a different question, and it is not a question we have learned to answer with optimism."

Ishiba was scheduled to address the LDP's executive board on Monday morning.
