# South Korea's Constitutional Court Prepares Landmark Ruling on Impeached President Yoon as Political Crisis Enters Critical Week

**SEOUL, Feb. 21** — South Korea's Constitutional Court signalled on Friday that it was approaching a final decision on whether to uphold or overturn the impeachment of President Yoon Suk-yeol, whose declaration of martial law for six hours on the night of December 3rd last year — an act without precedent in South Korea's democratic history and one that his own ruling party swiftly repudiated — triggered a constitutional crisis whose resolution by the eight-member court will either confirm Yoon's permanent removal from office and trigger a presidential election within 60 days or restore him to a presidency whose political viability most analysts regard as irreparably destroyed regardless of the court's formal verdict.

The court's chief justice Moon Hyung-bae told reporters outside the Constitutional Court building in Seoul on Friday that deliberations were "in their final stage" and that a ruling date would be announced with a minimum of one week's notice — language that legal observers interpreted as indicating a decision within two to three weeks, substantially ahead of the court's formal 180-day deadline of June 12th. The announcement came after weeks of intense political pressure on the court from both sides of the country's sharpest political divide in a generation, including demonstrations outside the court building by Yoon supporters that have at times drawn hundreds of thousands of participants and counter-demonstrations by those demanding his removal that have been comparably large.

The martial law declaration of December 3rd, which Yoon announced in a televised address accusing the opposition Democratic Party of "anti-state activities" and "sympathising with North Korean communist forces" — charges that his own prosecutors have been unable to substantiate — lasted until the National Assembly voted to lift it in the early hours of December 4th, with enough members of Yoon's own People Power Party joining the opposition to produce the required majority. The episode lasted six hours from declaration to lifting, but its political consequences have been permanent and its legal consequences remain unresolved after eleven weeks in which South Korea has been governed by a succession of acting presidents while Yoon has remained in detention, arrested in January on insurrection charges in an unprecedented law enforcement operation that itself triggered competing claims of legal authority between different investigative agencies.

The Constitutional Court's deliberations are subject to strict confidentiality, and the justices have not disclosed their reasoning or the current state of their internal discussions. Under South Korean constitutional law, Yoon's removal requires the agreement of at least six of the court's eight justices — three positions remain vacant following the expiration of terms that the deadlocked National Assembly has been unable to fill through the normal appointment process, leaving the court to rule with eight members rather than its full complement of nine. Legal scholars have noted that the six-of-eight threshold is mathematically equivalent to requiring a supermajority even among a reduced bench.

A legal affairs analyst at Yonsei University, Oh Dong-woon, said on Friday that based on the public record of the court's proceedings — including the questions justices had posed during oral arguments and the specific constitutional provisions they had asked parties to address — he assessed the most likely outcome as removal, though with a degree of uncertainty that he declined to quantify precisely. "The core question is whether what happened on December 3rd constitutes an insurrection under the constitutional definition, or whether it was an illegal act of a different character," he said. "The martial law declaration was clearly illegal. Whether it rises to the level that mandates removal involves a legal judgment on which reasonable people differ."

Yoon's defence team has argued throughout the proceedings that the martial law declaration, however imprudent, was a constitutionally authorised act that the president believed necessary to address what he described as legislative obstruction by the Democratic Party, which had used its supermajority in the National Assembly to reject his budgets and block his legislative agenda for two years. They have argued that the rapid reversal of the declaration demonstrated it was never intended as a permanent authoritarian takeover and that the insurrection charge requires evidence of intent to overthrow the constitutional order that the prosecution has not provided.

The prosecution and the Democratic Party's legal team have countered that the deployment of special forces to the National Assembly building — troops who were repelled by assembly staff and legislators physically blocking entry — constitutes evidence of intent to prevent the legislature from exercising its constitutional authority to lift the declaration, and that the brevity of the episode reflected the failure of the attempt rather than the absence of the intent. The Constitutional Court's assessment of that factual and legal dispute will define the ruling.

The political consequences of each possible outcome are simultaneously high and asymmetric. If the court upholds the impeachment, a presidential election must be held within 60 days, a timeline that would produce a vote in late April or early May. The Democratic Party's candidate, almost certainly former party leader Lee Jae-myung — who leads all published polling by substantial margins and who is simultaneously navigating his own legal jeopardy from corruption and financial fraud charges whose resolution has been complicated by the political crisis — would be the heavy favourite. The People Power Party faces the additional challenge of selecting a credible candidate from a field diminished by the political wreckage of the martial law episode.

If the court overturns the impeachment and Yoon is restored to office, the political and constitutional crisis would enter a new and potentially more dangerous phase. Yoon would return to a presidency operating under criminal investigation for insurrection — a charge that carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment or death under South Korean law — with a National Assembly in which the opposition holds a supermajority, a PPP whose majority publicly repudiated him, and a public opinion environment in which his approval ratings have remained in the single digits since December. Several constitutional scholars have argued that restoration would not resolve the crisis but would simply relocate it.

South Korea's international relationships have operated under considerable strain during the political interregnum. The acting presidents who have governed in succession — Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok currently holds the role — have maintained continuity of foreign policy posture but have lacked the political authority to make significant decisions on alliance management, trade negotiations, or the rapidly evolving North Korean situation. North Korea, whose relationship with South Korea has been in a state of near-total rupture since Kim Jong-un's 2023 declaration that reunification was no longer a goal, launched what South Korean military assessors described as a medium-range ballistic missile test into the East Sea on Wednesday — a provocation whose timing, in the context of Seoul's political paralysis, several analysts interpreted as calculated.

The United States, whose alliance with South Korea is among its most significant in the Indo-Pacific, has maintained careful neutrality on the constitutional proceedings while underlining its commitment to the alliance regardless of their outcome. A State Department spokesperson said on Friday that Washington "respects South Korea's democratic institutions and their processes" and had "full confidence in the resilience of the ROK-US alliance." Behind that diplomatic formulation, American officials have watched the crisis with considerable anxiety, particularly given the concurrent management demands placed on the alliance by North Korean provocations and the broader deterioration of the security environment in Northeast Asia.

The Constitutional Court's security arrangements have been significantly enhanced in recent weeks following threats against individual justices that prosecutors have attributed to extreme factions within the pro-Yoon movement. Three individuals have been arrested on charges related to threatening communications sent to justices' private addresses, and the court building has operated under expanded police protection since January.

In Seoul's streets, the polarisation that the crisis has produced shows no sign of abating. The Saturday demonstrations that have alternated between pro-impeachment and anti-impeachment crowds in Gwanghwamun Square and its surroundings since December have become a fixture of Seoul's weekend landscape, drawing participants who describe their attendance not primarily as political activism but as a fundamental assertion of their vision of what South Korea is and should be.

"I have come every Saturday since December," said Park Ji-young, a 34-year-old teacher attending a pro-impeachment rally outside the court building on Friday afternoon. "This is about whether we are a democracy or not. It is that simple and it is that important."

A ruling date announcement is expected early next week.
