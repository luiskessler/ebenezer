# Bangladesh Garment Sector Faces Collapse of Major European Contracts After Factory Safety Audit Failures

**DHAKA, Feb. 21** — At least fourteen major European retail brands have suspended or placed under formal review their sourcing contracts with Bangladeshi garment manufacturers in the past six weeks, following the publication of a damning independent audit commissioned by the Amsterdam-based Fair Wear Foundation that documented widespread violations of fire safety, structural integrity, and working hour standards across 340 factories inspected between October and January, threatening an industry that accounts for 84 percent of Bangladesh's total export earnings and employs an estimated 4.2 million workers, the majority of them women.

The audit report, released on February 3rd and running to 312 pages, found that 61 percent of inspected facilities had at least one structural deficiency classified as high-risk, that 43 percent lacked functioning fire suppression systems meeting the standards agreed under the 2013 Accord on Fire and Building Safety — the legally binding framework established in the aftermath of the Rana Plaza collapse that killed 1,138 people — and that in 29 percent of factories, workers reported regular compulsory overtime exceeding legal limits without appropriate compensation. The findings were described by the Foundation's executive director, Alexandra Geiser, as "a significant regression from the progress recorded between 2015 and 2021."

"We are not back to where we were before Rana Plaza," Geiser said at a press briefing in Brussels on February 4th. "But we are moving in that direction, and that trajectory is unacceptable."

The brands that have announced contract suspensions or reviews include several of Europe's largest fast-fashion and mid-market retailers, among them two Swedish groups, a German catalogue retailer, and a Dutch clothing chain, none of which have consented to be named publicly at this stage of what they describe as ongoing supplier dialogue. A spokesperson for one suspended brand, who agreed to speak only without attribution, said the decision had been made reluctantly and with awareness of its consequences for workers. "We are not walking away from Bangladesh," the spokesperson said. "We are insisting on a standard that should not be controversial twelve years after Rana Plaza."

The Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association responded with a mixture of defensiveness and alarm. BGMEA president Khandaker Rafiqul Islam acknowledged at a press conference in Dhaka on Thursday that the audit findings were "serious and could not be dismissed" but argued that the Foundation's methodology had overweighted structural assessments conducted during a period when many factories were operating temporary extensions or modifications put in place after flooding damaged several industrial zones in Chattogram and Gazipur last monsoon season. He called for a period of dialogue before any permanent contract cancellations took effect and warned that precipitate action by European buyers would harm the very workers whose welfare the audit was meant to protect.

That argument has found a degree of sympathy among labour economists, though not unconditional support. "The concern about worker harm from contract suspension is real and it should be taken seriously," said Drusilla Brown, a professor of economics at Tufts University who has studied the garment industry's labour compliance architecture extensively. "But it has also historically been the argument used to forestall accountability indefinitely. The question is whether it is being made in good faith this time, and whether the industry has the institutional capacity to deliver on remediation commitments it has made before and not fully honoured."

The political context in Bangladesh has added a further layer of complexity. The country has been governed since August by an interim administration led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus following the ouster of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina amid mass protests, and the institutional capacity of labour and factory inspection bodies has been significantly disrupted by the political transition. Sources within the interim government's commerce ministry, speaking privately, acknowledged that the number of certified factory inspectors had fallen by approximately a third since August as personnel with ties to the previous administration departed or were suspended, and that the inspection backlog had grown substantially.

Yunus's administration has publicly committed to a comprehensive reform of labour governance as part of a broader programme of institutional renewal, and has sought support from the International Labour Organisation for technical assistance in rebuilding inspection capacity. An ILO mission visited Dhaka in January and is expected to produce recommendations by the end of March. However, a senior ILO official familiar with the mission's preliminary findings, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the timeline for restoring functional inspection capacity was "considerably longer than the political messaging suggests."

The European Union's due diligence regulation, which came into force last year and requires companies above a certain revenue threshold to conduct and document human rights and environmental risk assessments across their supply chains, has given European buyers both a legal incentive and a legal obligation to respond to the audit's findings. Several of the brands that have suspended contracts cited the regulation explicitly in their public statements, framing their decisions as compliance obligations rather than discretionary choices.

That framing has drawn criticism from Bangladeshi trade unions and some international labour rights organisations, who argue that brands are using regulatory compliance language to avoid acknowledging their own role in creating the conditions that produce audit failures. "These brands chose Bangladesh because it is cheap," said Kalpona Akter, executive director of the Bangladesh Center for Worker Solidarity, in an interview on Friday. "The price pressure they impose is one of the primary reasons factory owners cut corners on safety. Suspending contracts without addressing that dynamic is not a solution. It is a performance."

The immediate economic stakes are substantial. Bangladesh's garment export sector generated approximately $47 billion in revenue in the last fiscal year, and the contracts currently suspended or under review represent, by BGMEA's own estimate, somewhere between $800 million and $1.2 billion in annual order value. If a significant portion of those contracts are permanently cancelled rather than reinstated following remediation, the impact on employment in an economy already under severe fiscal pressure would be considerable.

Remediation timelines are the central practical question. Factory owners' associations have proposed a structured 180-day correction period with third-party verification at 60-day intervals. Several European brands have indicated privately they could accept a framework along those lines. Whether the interim government can provide the regulatory backing and inspection capacity to make such a framework credible remains the question on which the industry's near-term future largely depends.
