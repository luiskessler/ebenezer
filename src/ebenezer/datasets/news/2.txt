Indonesia Moves to Restrict Foreign Ownership of Subsea Cable Infrastructure Amid Espionage Concerns

JAKARTA, Feb. 21 — Indonesia's government announced on Thursday a sweeping regulatory overhaul that would require foreign telecommunications companies operating subsea cable infrastructure in its territorial waters to transfer majority ownership stakes to state-approved domestic entities within three years, a move that drew sharp protests from the United States and Japan and raised fresh questions about the future of several major Pacific data corridor projects currently under construction.

The new framework, published by the Ministry of Communication and Digital Affairs in a 47-page regulatory gazette and set to take effect provisionally on March 1, applies to all active and planned cable landing stations on Indonesian soil, of which there are currently 26. It mandates that no single foreign entity may hold more than a 35 percent stake in any licensed cable operating consortium and introduces a national security screening process modelled loosely on mechanisms used by Australia and the European Union, according to ministry officials who briefed journalists in Jakarta on Thursday morning.

Communications Minister Meutya Hafid framed the decision as a matter of sovereign infrastructure control. "Indonesia sits at the crossroads of global data flows," she said at a press conference. "It is not reasonable, and it is not safe, that the arteries of our digital economy should be owned and operated primarily by parties whose interests do not align with those of our people."

The announcement landed with immediate commercial consequences. Shares in three Singapore-listed telecommunications holding companies with significant Indonesian cable exposure fell between 4 and 7 percent on Thursday afternoon trading. A consortium led by Google and Meta, which last year announced a joint subsea cable project called Bifrost intended to link North America, Southeast Asia and Japan via Indonesian landing points, declined to comment publicly but is understood to be seeking urgent clarification from Jakarta on how the new rules would apply to its existing permits. Sources familiar with the matter said private consultations between the consortium's legal teams and ministry officials had been scheduled for early next week.

The regulatory move has been in preparation since at least last October, when Indonesia's National Cyber and Encryption Agency submitted a classified threat assessment to the Presidential Palace outlining what it described as "systematic vulnerabilities" in foreign-operated cable infrastructure. A senior official with direct knowledge of that assessment, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the document remains classified, said the agency had identified at least two instances in recent months in which maintenance operations conducted by foreign-flagged cable repair vessels occurred without the prior notification required under existing regulations.

"The concern is not hypothetical," the official said. "The question of who can physically access these cables, and under what circumstances, has moved from a theoretical security discussion to an operational one."

Washington reacted swiftly. A spokesperson for the US National Security Council said Thursday that the administration was "engaging Indonesian counterparts at the highest levels" and had requested a formal explanation of how the new ownership thresholds were derived. Japan's Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications issued a more restrained statement expressing "hope for continued dialogue," though a senior Japanese diplomat in Jakarta, speaking privately to Reuters on Thursday, said Tokyo was "genuinely alarmed" by the speed of the announcement and its potential implications for a planned Japan–Indonesia–Australia data link currently in the permitting phase.

The regulatory shift reflects a broader and accelerating contest over subsea cable infrastructure across the Indo-Pacific. China has invested heavily in its own cable network in the region in recent years, while the United States has moved to block Chinese participation in several Pacific cable projects, including a proposed link to the Pacific island nations of Micronesia and Palau. Indonesia, which has historically maintained a non-aligned foreign policy and counts both Washington and Beijing among its major economic partners, has until recently resisted pressure from either side to explicitly align its digital infrastructure policy with one camp's security framework.

Thursday's announcement does not name any specific country as a threat. The ministry's gazette refers only to "entities incorporated in jurisdictions assessed by the relevant national authority as presenting elevated intelligence risk" — language that lawyers in Jakarta said on Thursday was broad enough to apply, in principle, to companies from any number of countries, including potentially the United States.

Minister Hafid insisted the rules were non-discriminatory. However, James Lewis, a senior vice president at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, warned that the vagueness of the risk-assessment criteria created significant legal uncertainty. "The process by which a jurisdiction gets designated as elevated risk is completely opaque," he said. "That's not a security framework, that's discretionary power, and discretionary power in infrastructure regulation tends to follow political winds."

The three-year transition window has been welcomed cautiously by some industry figures as more generous than initially feared. Indonesia's domestic telecommunications giant Telkom Indonesia, which would stand to benefit substantially from the ownership transfer requirements, issued a statement on Thursday saying it was "ready to fulfill its national responsibility" and would begin consultations with foreign partners immediately.

Whether those partners agree to negotiate rather than litigate remains, for now, an open question. At least two foreign operators are understood to be reviewing whether Indonesia's new framework is compatible with bilateral investment treaty obligations, according to people with knowledge of those internal discussions.

A follow-up legislative session to give the regulatory gazette full statutory backing is scheduled for April.
