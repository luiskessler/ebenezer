# Senegal's New Government Uncovers Alleged Fiscal Fraud at State Mining Company as IMF Warns of Hidden Debt

**DAKAR, Feb. 21** — Senegal's government disclosed on Friday that a forensic audit of the state mining and hydrocarbons company Petrosen, commissioned by President Bassirou Diomaye Faye's administration eight months after it took power in March 2024 on a platform of radical transparency and anti-corruption reform, had uncovered evidence of what auditors described as a systematic programme of off-balance-sheet borrowing, contract inflation, and revenue diversion totalling an estimated 2.3 trillion CFA francs — approximately $3.8 billion — conducted over a seven-year period under the administration of former President Macky Sall, whose government had presented Petrosen as a model of African state enterprise management and whose tenure had coincided with the discovery and early development of Senegal's substantial offshore oil and gas reserves.

The disclosure, delivered in a 94-page summary document released by the economy ministry in Dakar on Friday morning, came one week after the International Monetary Fund published a staff assessment warning that Senegal's actual public debt burden was significantly higher than figures previously reported to the Fund, and that the fiscal accounts submitted by the Sall government for the period 2019 to 2023 contained material misstatements whose full extent remained to be quantified. The IMF assessment, which paused disbursement of the final tranche of a $1.8 billion programme agreed with the previous government pending clarification of the debt picture, had already shaken Senegalese financial markets and drawn intense international attention to a country that had been widely regarded as one of West Africa's most stable and well-governed economies.

"What the audit has found is not bureaucratic irregularity," said Finance Minister Cheikh Diba at a press conference in Dakar on Friday. "It is the deliberate construction of a parallel fiscal reality, designed to present international partners and Senegalese citizens with a picture of the public finances that bore no relationship to the truth."

The findings implicate a network of former senior officials, board members, and private contractors whose identities the government said would be referred to the Cour de Répression de l'Enrichissement Illicite — Senegal's anti-corruption court — within thirty days. The auditors identified at least fourteen contracts awarded to companies in which Petrosen board members or their immediate family members held undisclosed ownership interests, and traced revenue flows from two offshore gas development agreements that should have accrued to the state treasury through intermediate accounts registered in Mauritius and Luxembourg before reaching destinations that the audit describes as "unconnected to any legitimate operational purpose of the enterprise."

Former President Sall, who left office following Faye's victory and has since maintained a relatively low public profile, issued a statement through his political party, the Alliance Pour la République, on Friday categorically rejecting the audit's findings and describing the disclosure as "a politically motivated persecution dressed as institutional accountability." The statement accused the Faye government of manufacturing a crisis to distract from what it characterised as its own governance failures in its first year in power and announced that Sall's legal team would file an urgent application before the Constitutional Council challenging the legality of the audit process. Two former ministers from the Sall government — the former petroleum minister and the former economy minister — also issued individual denials through legal representatives.

The international financial implications are considerable and extend beyond Senegal's bilateral relationship with the IMF. The country is scheduled to begin commercial oil production from the Sangomar field in partnership with Woodside Energy of Australia later this year, and first gas exports from the GTA project — a joint development with Mauritania involving BP and Kosmos Energy — are expected to follow in 2025. Those projects had been positioned as the centrepiece of Senegal's economic transformation narrative, promising government revenues that analysts had projected would reach $1 billion annually by the end of the decade.

The audit's findings have raised questions among international investors and development finance institutions about the governance framework within which those revenues will be managed. A senior official at the African Development Bank, speaking without authorisation because the bank is in active programme discussions with Dakar, said the institution had placed a planned $400 million infrastructure lending programme under internal review pending assessment of the fiscal disclosure's implications for Senegal's debt sustainability. "The question is not whether the oil money is real," the official said. "The question is whether we now understand the container into which it will flow."

The World Bank, which has maintained an active programme portfolio in Senegal and which had in previous assessments cited the country as a model of natural resource governance reform, issued a carefully worded statement on Friday welcoming the Faye government's commitment to transparency and offering technical assistance for the strengthening of public financial management systems, without commenting directly on the audit's specific findings.

Senegal's relationship with its CFA franc zone partners adds a further institutional dimension. As a member of the West African Economic and Monetary Union and a user of the CFA franc — a currency whose peg to the euro is managed by the Banque Centrale des États de l'Afrique de l'Ouest under arrangements that involve French treasury guarantees — Senegal's fiscal accounts are subject to WAEMU convergence surveillance. The zone's multilateral surveillance mechanism had not flagged the fiscal discrepancies subsequently identified by the forensic audit, a failure that WAEMU's commission in Ouagadougou has not yet publicly addressed.

The political context of the disclosure involves a delicate domestic calculation for Faye and his prime minister Ousmane Sonko, whose Pastef party swept to power on a wave of anti-establishment sentiment driven largely by younger Senegalese voters who had grown frustrated with what they characterised as the Sall government's combination of economic management expertise and elite enrichment. The audit findings confirm the narrative on which Pastef built its political project, providing the new government with both vindication and a renewed mandate — but also with the challenge of managing a fiscal crisis whose dimensions are not yet fully mapped in an economy that had been counting on oil revenues to underwrite its development ambitions.

Thierno Alassane Sall, an opposition figure unrelated to the former president and a long-standing critic of Petrosen's governance, said on Friday that the audit findings were "more extensive than even the most pessimistic independent analysis had suggested" but warned the Faye government against allowing the accountability process to become purely backward-looking. "The question is not only what was stolen," he said. "The question is what governance architecture will prevent the same thing from happening again with the oil money that is now arriving."

The CFA franc came under modest speculative pressure on regional currency markets on Friday, with spreads on Senegalese Eurobonds widening by approximately 45 basis points in London trading before recovering partially in the afternoon session.

Rating agency Moody's said it was placing Senegal's Ba3 sovereign rating on review for downgrade. S&P and Fitch had not responded to the developments by Friday evening.

The attorney general's office said arrests were expected within the coming weeks.
