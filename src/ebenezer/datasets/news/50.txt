# Uganda's Opposition Leader Besigye Faces Military Tribunal as East African Court Orders Release Ignored

**KAMPALA, Feb. 21** — Uganda's government defied a binding order from the East African Court of Justice for the third consecutive week on Friday, refusing to release opposition leader Dr. Kizza Besigye from military detention despite a February 3rd court ruling that his continued detention without civilian trial violated the Treaty for the Establishment of the East African Community and constituted what the court's seven-judge panel described as "a fundamental breach of the rule of law obligations that membership of this community requires," as proceedings began before a General Court Martial in Kampala that Besigye's legal team characterised as a show trial designed to create a veneer of legal process around what it described as a politically motivated disappearance conducted by Ugandan state agents on foreign soil.

Besigye, 67, who ran against President Yoweri Museveni in four presidential elections between 2001 and 2016 and who has been arrested more than 50 times during his political career without a single successful prosecution, was abducted in Nairobi on November 16th last year in circumstances that the Kenyan government described as a "kidnapping conducted by foreign agents on Kenyan territory" and that triggered a diplomatic crisis between Nairobi and Kampala whose surface has been smoothed by subsequent bilateral engagement but whose underlying tension has not been resolved. He was transported to Uganda without extradition proceedings and has been held at Makindye Military Barracks in Kampala since his return, charged before the General Court Martial with terrorism, unlawful possession of firearms, and what the charges sheet describes as "treachery" — offences whose application to a civilian political opponent through a military tribunal system has been condemned by virtually every international human rights organisation that has assessed the case.

The General Court Martial proceedings that opened on Friday were immediately challenged by Besigye's legal team, led by veteran human rights lawyer Ladislaus Rwakafuuzi, who filed applications contesting the tribunal's jurisdiction over a civilian defendant, the admissibility of evidence allegedly obtained under duress, and the compatibility of military tribunal proceedings with Uganda's own constitutional guarantees of fair trial before an independent civilian court. The presiding military judge, Brigadier Robert Machumu, rejected all three preliminary applications without extended reasoning and ordered the prosecution to begin presenting its case, a decision that Rwakafuuzi described outside the tribunal as "predetermined justice" and announced he would immediately appeal to Uganda's Constitutional Court.

The East African Court of Justice's February 3rd order, whose defiance has placed Uganda in the most serious breach of its EAC obligations since the community's establishment, directed Kampala to release Besigye immediately on humanitarian grounds — he has reported deteriorating health during his detention and his lawyers say he has been denied adequate medical care — and to transfer any criminal proceedings to civilian courts with full due process protections. The court's orders are legally binding on EAC member states under Article 38 of the EAC Treaty, and their continued defiance exposes Uganda to enforcement mechanisms including suspension of certain community benefits and, in the most extreme scenario contemplated by the treaty framework, suspension from the community itself.

Attorney General Kiryowa Kiwanuka told journalists in Kampala on Friday that Uganda "respects the East African Court of Justice as an institution" but maintained that the court had "exceeded its jurisdiction" in ordering the release of an individual facing terrorism charges that the government characterised as "a matter of national security beyond the court's competence." He did not address the jurisdictional argument under which the court had asserted authority, instead reiterating the government's position that Besigye's case was proceeding through "lawful judicial processes" and would be decided on its merits.

That position has found essentially no international acceptance. Kenya's government, whose territory was violated by the operation that brought Besigye to Uganda, has maintained a public posture of diplomatic engagement — Foreign Minister Musalia Mudavadi held a bilateral meeting with his Ugandan counterpart in Nairobi last month that produced a joint communiqué emphasising the importance of the bilateral relationship without addressing the Besigye case specifically — while Kenyan civil society organisations and opposition figures have maintained sustained pressure on Nairobi to take a harder line. A senior Kenyan foreign ministry official, speaking privately, said the government's assessment was that maintaining functional bilateral relations with Uganda served Kenyan interests better than a sustained public confrontation, but acknowledged that the abduction had created "a precedent whose implications for the safety of political figures operating in Kenya we take very seriously."

Tanzania, Rwanda, and Burundi — the other EAC member states — have said nothing publicly about Uganda's defiance of the court order, a silence that the court's registrar, in an unusually direct communication to member state foreign ministries last week, described as "incompatible with the collective responsibility that EAC treaty membership entails."

Rwanda's silence has been particularly noted given President Paul Kagame's historical personal antipathy toward Besigye — the two men share a complicated political history from the period of Besigye's time in the Rwandan Patriotic Front before his emergence as a Ugandan opposition figure — and given Rwanda's own record of pursuing political opponents beyond its borders through means that human rights organisations have documented and that the current Besigye case bears some structural resemblance to.

The United States, which provides Uganda with significant security and development assistance and has historically been reluctant to apply sustained pressure on Museveni's government given its cooperation on counter-terrorism operations in the region and its contributions to African Union peacekeeping missions, issued a statement on Friday calling for Besigye's transfer to civilian courts and for Uganda's compliance with the EAC court order. The statement stopped short of threatening specific consequences and did not mention the possibility of aid conditionality, an omission that Ugandan opposition figures described as reflecting the limits of American commitment to the democratic principles its statements invoke.

The European Union's response was marginally stronger. High Representative Kaja Kallas issued a statement condemning the military tribunal proceedings as "incompatible with the rule of law standards that Uganda has committed to under multiple international frameworks" and warning that the EU was "reviewing the implications for its bilateral programme with Uganda" — language that officials in Brussels confirmed was intended as a preliminary signal toward potential aid conditionality rather than an immediate policy change.

Amnesty International designated Besigye a prisoner of conscience on Friday, the organisation's most significant classification for detained individuals, and launched a global campaign calling for his immediate and unconditional release. Human Rights Watch published a detailed legal analysis arguing that the military tribunal charges were "transparently pretextual" and that the terrorism allegations in particular lacked any evidentiary foundation that had been publicly disclosed.

Museveni, who has ruled Uganda since 1986 and who at 79 remains one of Africa's longest-serving leaders, has not addressed the Besigye case in any public statement since his detention, a silence that political analysts in Kampala interpreted as consistent with his characteristic practice of allowing institutional processes — however compromised — to provide deniability for politically motivated actions while maintaining his personal distance from their specifics.

Uganda's domestic opposition, fragmented and operating under severe restrictions following the violent 2021 election period that saw the security forces conduct widespread abductions of supporters of National Unity Platform leader Bobi Wine — real name Robert Kyagulanyi — has been unable to mount sustained street-level pressure on the Besigye case, partly from security concerns and partly because the political relationship between Besigye's Forum for Democratic Change and the younger NUP movement has been complicated by competition and personal tension.

Inside Makindye Military Barracks, where Besigye has been held for three months, his physical condition remains a source of acute concern to his family and legal team. His wife, Winnie Byanyima — executive director of UNAIDS and one of Uganda's most prominent international figures — has maintained a public campaign for his release that has reached audiences well beyond Uganda's borders and that has placed the case on the agenda of international health and development forums in ways that have visibly irritated Ugandan government officials. She issued a statement on Friday describing her husband as showing signs of physical deterioration and accusing the government of "using his body as a weapon against his spirit."

The General Court Martial is scheduled to continue hearings on Monday. Rwakafuuzi said his constitutional court appeal would be filed before the weekend.
