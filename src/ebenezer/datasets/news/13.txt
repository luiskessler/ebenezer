# UN Nuclear Watchdog Reports Unexplained Enrichment Activity at Undeclared Iranian Site as Diplomatic Window Narrows

**VIENNA, Feb. 21** — The International Atomic Energy Agency informed its 35-member Board of Governors in a confidential report circulated on Thursday that inspectors had detected traces of uranium enriched to 84 percent purity — one percentage point below weapons-grade — at a previously undeclared centrifuge assembly facility near the city of Qazvin, approximately 150 kilometres northwest of Tehran, a finding that senior Western diplomats described on Friday as the most alarming disclosure from the agency's Iran monitoring programme since the collapse of the 2015 nuclear accord.

The report, whose contents were described to Reuters and other news organisations by diplomats who had received briefings on its findings, also noted that Iran had failed to provide a satisfactory explanation for the presence of enriched material at a site that Iranian authorities had not disclosed under the terms of the Non-Proliferation Treaty's Additional Protocol, to which Iran was previously bound before it suspended its cooperation with enhanced inspection arrangements in February 2021. The IAEA declined to comment on the specific contents of the document, citing its standard policy on confidential Board communications, but Director General Rafael Grossi acknowledged at a press briefing in Vienna on Friday that the agency's ability to provide credible assurances about the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear programme had "continued to deteriorate."

"The agency's knowledge of what Iran is doing has gaps that we cannot close without the cooperation and access we are not receiving," Grossi said. "I want to be precise: we are not in a position to confirm that Iran is building a weapon. We are also not in a position to confirm that it is not."

The finding landed in a diplomatic environment of acute sensitivity. The Trump administration, which returned to office in January and which abandoned the nuclear accord during Trump's first term in 2018, has signalled simultaneously that it is open to negotiating a new agreement with Tehran and that it will not tolerate Iranian nuclear advances during any negotiating period. Special envoy Steve Witkoff held a preliminary back-channel conversation with Iranian deputy foreign minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi in Oman earlier this month, the first direct US-Iran diplomatic contact in more than two years, according to three people familiar with the exchange. Neither government has officially confirmed the meeting.

Iran's foreign ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei denied on Friday that any enrichment activity at undeclared facilities had taken place and described the IAEA report as "technically distorted and politically motivated." He insisted Iran's nuclear programme remained entirely within civilian bounds and accused Western governments of manufacturing a crisis to justify continued sanctions pressure. Iran's Atomic Energy Organisation issued a separate statement calling the 84 percent figure "a measurement anomaly arising from technical contamination" and saying a full technical explanation had been submitted to the IAEA — a characterisation the agency's spokesperson declined to confirm or deny.

The discovery of near-weapons-grade material at an undeclared site, if confirmed, would represent a qualitative escalation beyond Iran's previously acknowledged enrichment activities. Iran has since 2021 enriched uranium to 60 percent purity at its declared Fordow and Natanz facilities, a level that already has no credible civilian application and that placed it within relatively short technical reach of weapons-grade material. The additional finding at Qazvin, if accurate, suggests either that Iran is operating parallel undeclared enrichment streams or, as Iranian officials contend, that material was transferred from declared facilities in a manner that resulted in cross-contamination at the Qazvin site.

European signatories to the original accord — France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, collectively known as the E3 — convened an emergency political directors meeting in Paris on Thursday evening following receipt of the IAEA report and issued a joint statement on Friday calling on Iran to "immediately and unconditionally grant IAEA inspectors full access to all sites relevant to the investigation." The statement warned that the E3 were "prepared to consider all available mechanisms under the NPT framework" — language that diplomats said was a carefully calibrated reference to the so-called snapback mechanism that could reimpose UN Security Council sanctions, a process the E3 initiated in 2020 and which technically remains available until October 2025 under the original accord's sunset provisions.

Russia and China, both permanent Security Council members and parties to the original accord, have consistently opposed Western pressure on Iran's nuclear programme and have provided Tehran with varying degrees of diplomatic protection at the IAEA Board and the Security Council. A Russian foreign ministry spokesperson said on Friday that Moscow urged "all parties to exercise restraint and return to dialogue," while implicitly criticising the IAEA report's timing as unhelpful to diplomatic efforts. China's foreign ministry said Beijing supported "a diplomatic resolution through dialogue" and called on the United States to demonstrate good faith by lifting sanctions.

Israel, which has conducted covert operations against Iran's nuclear programme for more than two decades — including the 2021 sabotage attack on the Natanz facility attributed to Israeli intelligence — has watched the latest disclosures with what officials described as grim vindication. Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said on Friday that the IAEA findings proved Iran was "racing toward a bomb under the cover of diplomatic engagement" and called on the international community to impose maximum pressure immediately. He did not address the question of potential Israeli military action, though Israeli officials have maintained for months that a military option remains on the table if diplomatic avenues fail to arrest Iran's nuclear progress.

A senior American official, speaking anonymously because diplomatic exchanges on the matter remain sensitive, said Washington was treating the IAEA report with "the utmost seriousness" and was consulting with allies on a coordinated response. The official declined to specify what measures were under consideration but said the administration's position was that Iran could not be permitted to use negotiating engagement as cover for continued nuclear advances. "Talks and enrichment at this level cannot proceed simultaneously," the official said. "That is a red line."

The narrowing diplomatic window reflects a structural tension that has characterised the Iran nuclear issue for two decades: the pace of Iran's technical progress consistently outstrips the pace of diplomatic process. Analysts at the Institute for Science and International Security estimated last week that Iran's current enriched uranium stockpile, if further enriched to weapons grade, could theoretically provide sufficient fissile material for several nuclear devices within a matter of weeks — a timeline that, while dependent on assumptions about weaponisation capability that are separately uncertain, has compressed the decision space available to both diplomats and military planners.

An emergency session of the IAEA Board of Governors has been requested by France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States and is expected to be convened in Vienna within the next ten days.
