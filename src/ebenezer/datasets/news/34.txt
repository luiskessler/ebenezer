# Poland's Border Crisis Escalates as Belarus Intensifies Migrant Pushes and First Polish Soldier Killed in Confrontation

**WARSAW, Feb. 21** — Poland declared a heightened security alert along its 418-kilometre border with Belarus on Friday after a Polish soldier died from injuries sustained during a confrontation in the Białowieża Forest zone on Wednesday night — the first fatality among Polish security personnel since the hybrid migration crisis engineered by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko began in 2021 — as Polish military commanders reported a sharp escalation in the frequency and organisation of migrant group crossings over the past three weeks that they attributed to direct coordination by Belarusian border guard units and, intelligence assessments suggested, elements of Russian military intelligence operating from Belarusian territory.

The soldier, identified by the defence ministry on Friday as Corporal Piotr Adamczyk, 24, from Rzeszów, sustained stab wounds during a confrontation with a group of approximately 80 migrants attempting to force a crossing at a location near the village of Hajnówka and died in a Białystok hospital on Thursday evening despite emergency surgery. The defence ministry confirmed that the group had been equipped with wire cutters, cutting torches capable of breaching steel barriers, and laser devices used to temporarily blind border guards and soldiers — equipment that Polish military intelligence assessed had been supplied by Belarusian security services based on technical analysis of items recovered at the crossing site.

Prime Minister Donald Tusk appeared at a press conference in Warsaw on Friday morning with Defence Minister Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz and Interior Minister Tomasz Siemoniak, visibly shaken, and described Corporal Adamczyk's death as "an act of war by other means" for which he held Lukashenko's regime and its Russian sponsors directly responsible. He announced a package of emergency measures including the deployment of an additional 2,500 troops to the border zone, the authorisation of expanded use of force rules for border guard personnel, a formal request for NATO to convene an emergency session of the North Atlantic Council under Article 4 — which allows members to consult when their territorial integrity or security is threatened — and the summoning of Belarus's chargé d'affaires to the foreign ministry.

Belarus, which has no ambassador in Warsaw following the complete breakdown of diplomatic relations in 2021, did not respond to the summoning. The Belarusian State Border Committee issued a statement on Friday accusing Poland of "fabricating provocations to justify the illegal and inhumane pushback of refugees" and asserting that its border personnel had conducted no operations in Polish territory. Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova, asked about the incident at her regular Friday briefing in Moscow, said Russia had "no information about the events described" and accused Poland of "deliberate escalation of tension on Europe's eastern flank for domestic political purposes."

NATO's response was swift by the alliance's deliberative standards. Secretary-General Mark Rutte issued a statement on Friday afternoon expressing "deep condolences" for Corporal Adamczyk's death, describing the incident as "part of a systematic pattern of hostile hybrid activity by the Lukashenko regime" and confirming that an Article 4 consultation session had been scheduled for Monday in Brussels. Alliance officials confirmed that NATO's enhanced forward presence battlegroup stationed in Poland — currently led by the United States and including troops from the United Kingdom, Croatia, and Romania — had been placed on a heightened readiness posture as a precautionary measure.

The European Union's reaction involved both condolence and controversy. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen expressed solidarity with Poland and described the border situation as "a deliberate and ongoing attack on European Union sovereignty." However, the European Parliament's civil liberties committee issued a parallel statement — scheduled before Friday's events but whose publication timing proved acutely awkward — expressing concern about documented pushbacks of asylum seekers by Polish border forces and calling for an independent investigation into allegations that migrants, including families with children, had been subjected to violence by Polish security personnel during forced returns to Belarusian territory.

That juxtaposition encapsulates the fundamental tension that has surrounded the Polish border crisis since its inception: the genuine and documented reality of Lukashenko weaponising vulnerable human beings as instruments of hybrid warfare sits alongside equally documented evidence of Polish security forces engaging in pushback practices that human rights organisations argue violate European and international law and that have resulted in migrant deaths from hypothermia and drowning in the Białowieża Forest zone.

A spokesperson for Médecins Sans Frontières, which has maintained a medical presence in the border zone and documented hundreds of cases of injured and hypothermic migrants who reported being forcibly returned to Belarus after reaching Polish territory, said on Friday that the organisation mourned Corporal Adamczyk's death and condemned any violence against Polish personnel while urging the Polish government not to use the incident as justification for "a further hardening of policies that are already causing preventable deaths among some of the world's most vulnerable people."

Tusk, whose government came to power in December 2023 ending eight years of Law and Justice party rule and who ran partly on a platform of restoring Poland's relationships with EU institutions strained under his predecessors, has found himself in the uncomfortable position of maintaining border policies that critics argue differ from those of the previous government primarily in rhetorical packaging rather than operational reality. His administration has extended the border exclusion zone established under the Law and Justice government and has resisted pressure from within his own coalition's left flank to expand humanitarian access to the border area.

A senior government official in the prime minister's office, speaking without authorisation, said the administration's internal position was that the hybrid warfare nature of the crisis justified emergency measures that would be unjustifiable in a conventional migration context. "We are not dealing with people who have simply arrived at a border seeking asylum," the official said. "We are dealing with people who are being weaponised — sometimes against their knowledge and sometimes with their complicity — as instruments of a deliberate Russian and Belarusian strategy to destabilise NATO's eastern flank. Those are different things and they require different responses." The official acknowledged that distinguishing between the two categories at the point of confrontation was "genuinely difficult and genuinely imperfect."

The Baltic states — Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, which share Poland's assessment of Russian-Belarusian hybrid warfare intent and face their own, smaller-scale versions of the same border pressure — issued a joint statement of solidarity with Warsaw on Friday and called for enhanced NATO and EU support for eastern flank border security. Finland and Sweden, both recent NATO members with their own assessments of Russian hybrid operations, expressed support for the Article 4 consultation.

Germany, which receives a significant share of the asylum seekers who eventually traverse Poland's territory, has maintained a more complicated position, balancing solidarity with Poland as a NATO ally and EU partner against domestic political pressure over migration management and legal concerns about pushback practices that German courts and the European Court of Human Rights have previously found to violate fundamental rights. The German interior ministry issued a statement of condolence for Corporal Adamczyk's death and support for Poland's right to protect its borders "within the framework of European law" — a qualifying clause that Polish officials in private described as "characteristically German."

In the villages and towns of the Podlaskie region along the border, where residents have lived with the crisis for three and a half years and where Corporal Adamczyk's death was felt with the immediate grief reserved for losses in one's own community, the mood on Friday was one of grim solidarity with the armed forces and deep anxiety about what the escalation portended.

"We have been saying for three years that this was going to get worse," said the mayor of Hajnówka, Jerzy Sirak, reached by telephone on Friday afternoon. "We did not want to be right."

The NATO North Atlantic Council session is scheduled for 10:00 Monday morning in Brussels.
