# Haiti's Transitional Council Fractures as Gang Coalition Controls 85 Percent of Port-au-Prince and Kenya-Led Force Requests Withdrawal

**PORT-AU-PRINCE, Feb. 21** — Haiti's already fragile transitional governance structure moved closer to complete collapse on Friday after two members of the Presidential Transitional Council resigned simultaneously, accusing the body's remaining members of corruption and paralysis, as the Kenyan government formally requested through diplomatic channels that the United Nations Security Council revise the mandate of the Multinational Security Support mission it leads in Haiti to include authorisation for a phased withdrawal beginning in ninety days, citing what Nairobi described as "mission conditions that have fundamentally exceeded the parameters within which the force was deployed and for which it was equipped and resourced."

The twin developments — internal political disintegration and the potential departure of the only internationally backed security force operating in the country — arrived against a backdrop of near-total gang control of Haiti's capital that United Nations monitors described on Friday as the most complete non-state territorial dominance of a capital city documented anywhere in the world in recent decades, with the Viv Ansanm coalition, an alliance between the Gran Grif and G9 gang federations that would have been considered unthinkable before its formation in late 2023, now exercising effective authority over an estimated 85 percent of Port-au-Prince's territory, controlling all major arterial roads, the primary seaport, and the majority of the city's food and fuel distribution infrastructure.

The two departing council members, representatives of the Fanmi Lavalas party and the Konvansyon Pati Popilè coalition, issued a joint statement accusing the council's chair, Edgard Leblanc Fils, and three other members of having accepted payments from business interests seeking preferential access to government procurement processes and of having deliberately delayed the formation of a permanent government to extend the council's own de facto power. Leblanc Fils categorically denied the allegations and accused the departing members of acting on behalf of political factions seeking to destabilise the transitional process for their own electoral advantage. Neither set of accusations could be independently verified within the timeframe of Friday's reporting.

The resignations reduce the council to seven members from its original nine-member composition and raise questions about whether it retains the quorum required under its own foundational charter to make binding decisions — a legal ambiguity that constitutional lawyers in Port-au-Prince said on Friday had no clear resolution given the absence of any functioning judicial body with authority to adjudicate it. The Organisation of American States, which participated in brokering the council's creation in 2024, issued an urgent statement calling on all parties to "preserve the institutional framework that represents Haiti's only viable path to democratic governance" and despatching a senior mediator to the Haitian capital for emergency consultations.

Kenya's request for a mandate revision represents the most significant external signal yet that the international community's appetite for an open-ended security commitment to Haiti — always limited and always contested — is approaching exhaustion. The Kenyan deployment, authorised by the UN Security Council in October 2023 and delayed by Kenyan domestic legal challenges for nearly a year before the first contingent arrived in June 2024, has operated under severe constraints from the outset: under-resourced relative to its mandate, limited in its rules of engagement, operating in an urban environment whose complexity exceeds the training and equipment of most of the contributing nations, and facing a gang coalition that has proven more militarily capable, better armed, and more tactically sophisticated than the force's pre-deployment assessments assumed.

A senior Kenyan military official, speaking without authorisation because the request is being handled through diplomatic channels, said the force had achieved meaningful results in specific operations but had been unable to translate tactical successes into sustained territorial control because it lacked the troop numbers, the logistical depth, and the Haitian police partnership capacity that a genuine counterinsurgency operation would require. "We came to support Haitian police in restoring security," the official said. "Haitian police have effectively ceased to function as an institution in Port-au-Prince. What we were asked to support no longer exists in the form it was assumed to exist."

The Haitian National Police, which had approximately 13,000 officers on paper before the current crisis deepened, has lost an estimated 40 percent of its effective strength to death, desertion, and defection since 2023, according to UN police advisers. Gang recruitment of former officers has been documented by the UN Integrated Office in Haiti, which reported last month that at least 200 former HNP officers were assessed to be operating within gang structures — bringing tactical and intelligence knowledge whose consequences have been felt in the failure of several MSS operations whose targets appeared to have had advance warning.

The United States, which has provided the largest financial contribution to the MSS mission — approximately $300 million out of a total roughly $600 million committed by all donors — has been reassessing its Haiti policy in the context of the Trump administration's broader review of foreign assistance commitments. A State Department official, speaking informally, said Washington had not yet determined its position on Kenya's withdrawal request and was consulting with Caribbean regional partners and UN member states about options for reconfiguring the mission. The official acknowledged that the administration's instinct was toward reduced rather than expanded international commitments but said the specific case of Haiti, given its proximity to American territory and the implications of state collapse for migration to the United States, created complications that "pure burden-shedding logic" did not fully resolve.

The gang coalition's leader, the alias-named Barbecue — real name Jimmy Chérizier, a former Haitian police officer whose transformation into the most powerful warlord in Haitian history has been one of the most consequential political developments in the Caribbean in a generation — has not issued a public statement since the council resignations and Kenya's withdrawal request became public on Friday. In previous statements, Chérizier has consistently argued that the transitional governance structure lacks democratic legitimacy and that his coalition represents a more genuine expression of popular will than the internationally recognised political process — an argument that his control of food and fuel distribution gives him growing practical leverage to make regardless of its democratic merits.

The humanitarian situation has reached dimensions that aid organisation representatives struggle to convey within the frameworks of emergency response that their institutions have designed for crises assumed to be temporary. The International Organisation for Migration estimated last month that 1.1 million people had been internally displaced in Haiti, the majority within Port-au-Prince itself, and that civilian movement through the city was constrained to such a degree that the conventional distinction between displacement and siege had ceased to be analytically useful. Cholera, which had been brought to the brink of elimination before the crisis deepened, has resurged significantly, with the Pan American Health Organization reporting case counts in January at three times the levels recorded in the same month of 2024.

UNICEF's Haiti representative, Gilles Fagninou, said on Friday that children were bearing the disproportionate burden of the crisis in ways whose long-term consequences would define Haitian society for a generation. "We are talking about children who have not attended school for two years," he said. "Children who have witnessed violence that no child should witness. Children who are being recruited into gang structures because no other structure is available to them. The humanitarian emergency of today is also the governance emergency of the next twenty years."

Regional Caribbean governments, several of which have expressed willingness in principle to contribute forces to an expanded MSS operation, reacted to Kenya's withdrawal request with alarm. Jamaica's foreign minister, Kamina Johnson Smith, said Kingston was "deeply troubled" by the development and called an emergency meeting of Caribbean Community foreign ministers for Tuesday to coordinate a regional response. Trinidad and Tobago's government, which faces its own gang violence crisis partly fuelled by weapons trafficking networks that connect to Haiti, said it was "urgently reviewing" its position on additional contributions to the security mission.

Whether any combination of additional international engagement, political reconfiguration of the transitional council, or negotiated accommodation with gang leadership can produce conditions in which Haitian state authority begins to be meaningfully restored is a question that specialists in Haitian politics and security answered on Friday with a consistency of pessimism that reflected not ideological predisposition but accumulated evidence.

"Haiti has been here before," said Robert Fatton Jr., a Haitian-American political scientist at the University of Virginia who has studied Haitian politics for four decades. "It has not been here quite like this. The combination of gang territorial control at this scale, governance collapse at this depth, and international fatigue at this level is genuinely without precedent in Haitian history. I do not know what the way out looks like, and I am cautious about anyone who claims they do."

The UN Security Council is expected to take up Kenya's mandate revision request at a session currently being scheduled for late next week.
