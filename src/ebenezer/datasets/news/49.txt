# Taiwan Strait Tensions Surge as China Conducts Unannounced Naval Encirclement Exercise and US Carrier Group Responds

**TAIPEI, Feb. 21** — China's People's Liberation Army Navy conducted what Taiwanese defence officials described on Friday as the largest unannounced naval encirclement exercise in the Taiwan Strait's recorded history, deploying an estimated 47 surface vessels, 12 submarines, and more than 90 military aircraft in a 72-hour operation that began without prior notification on Tuesday evening and that American naval commanders in the Pacific confirmed had triggered the deployment of the USS Carl Vinson carrier strike group from its scheduled port visit in Guam toward a position in the Philippine Sea approximately 350 nautical miles east of Taiwan — the closest an American carrier has operated to the strait during an active Chinese military exercise since the 1996 Taiwan Strait Crisis.

The exercise, which Chinese state media acknowledged only on Friday morning under the designation "Joint Sword-2026B" — a naming convention that explicitly invokes the Joint Sword exercise conducted in April 2023 following then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy's meeting with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen — came without the advance notice that China's military had provided before its two previous large-scale Taiwan exercises, a departure from recent practice that American, Japanese, and Taiwanese officials described as a deliberate choice whose significance extended beyond the operational details of the exercise itself.

"The absence of prior notification is not a logistical oversight," said Admiral Samuel Paparo, commander of US Indo-Pacific Command, in a statement released from Honolulu on Friday. "It is a signal about intent and about the operational posture China wishes to demonstrate. We are monitoring the situation with full attention and we have positioned forces appropriately."

Taiwan's Ministry of National Defence confirmed that PLA vessels had at various points during the 72-hour exercise operated within Taiwan's 24-nautical-mile contiguous zone — inside the boundary within which Taiwan asserts sovereign jurisdiction — and that 43 PLA Air Force sorties had crossed the median line in the Taiwan Strait, the informal boundary whose observance had served as a de facto crisis management mechanism until China began systematically crossing it in 2020. A Taiwanese F-16 patrol encountered a PLA J-20 stealth fighter over the median line on Thursday afternoon in what defence ministry officials described as a "professional but tense" interaction that lasted approximately eight minutes before the Chinese aircraft turned back.

The timing of the exercise has been linked by analysts to two developments in the preceding week. On February 12th, the Trump administration approved a $3.2 billion arms sale to Taiwan that included 400 advanced air-to-air missiles and upgrades to Taiwan's existing Patriot missile defence batteries — a sale that China's foreign ministry had condemned as "a gross interference in China's internal affairs" and had warned would have "severe consequences." Four days later, President Tsai's successor, President Lai Ching-te, gave an interview to the Wall Street Journal in which he described Taiwan as a "sovereign and independent nation" whose status was "not subject to determination by the People's Republic of China" — language that Beijing characterised as a "dangerous provocation" and that several American officials privately described as more direct than Washington had been expecting.

A senior American official, speaking on condition of strict anonymity because the situation involves active military operations, said the administration had been given no advance warning of the exercise by Chinese counterparts and that the lack of prior notification had complicated crisis management in ways that the official described as "genuinely concerning." The official said direct military-to-military communication channels between US and PLA commanders, which had been restored at the November 2023 Biden-Xi summit after a period of suspension and which are regarded as essential for preventing miscalculation during crisis episodes, had been activated within two hours of the exercise's commencement and had remained active throughout. "The lines are open," the official said. "What is being said through them is not something I will characterise."

China's foreign ministry, asked about the exercise at a Friday briefing in Beijing, confirmed its occurrence and described it as "a legitimate and necessary military exercise in response to provocative actions by separatist forces in Taiwan and their external supporters" that had been conducted "in full accordance with Chinese law and international norms." Spokesperson Lin Jian declined to provide information about the exercise's objectives, duration, or whether it had concluded, saying the PLA would provide information "at the appropriate time through appropriate channels."

Japan's reaction was swift and alarmed. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba convened the National Security Council in Tokyo on Friday morning and issued a statement describing the exercise as "a serious threat to regional peace and stability" and announcing the deployment of Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force destroyers to monitoring positions east of the Miyako Strait — through which PLA naval vessels transiting from the East China Sea to the Pacific regularly pass. Japan's foreign minister Takeshi Iwaya held telephone calls with his American and Taiwanese counterparts on Friday afternoon and said Tokyo was "in complete coordination" with Washington on its response.

The Philippines, whose waters south of Taiwan form part of the envelope within which the PLA exercise has been conducted and whose government has been navigating its own tense bilateral relationship with Beijing over South China Sea disputes, expressed "serious concern" through its foreign ministry and confirmed that its own naval vessels had been monitoring PLA activity in areas near the Bashi Channel connecting the South China Sea to the Pacific. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. was briefed by his national security adviser on Friday morning and held a telephone call with Ishiba in the afternoon.

South Korea, whose own complex relationship with China — its largest trading partner — has historically moderated Seoul's public statements on Taiwan Strait issues, issued a notably stronger statement than previous exercises had elicited, calling for "restraint and the avoidance of actions that escalate regional tension" and expressing "concern about the absence of prior notification" — the latter a specific and deliberate departure from Seoul's traditional formulations that defence analysts said reflected a genuine shift in South Korean strategic assessment of the regional security environment.

Australia's government described the exercise as "deeply destabilising" and convened an emergency parliamentary security briefing on Friday, a procedure reserved for situations of elevated national security concern. Defence Minister Richard Marles confirmed that Australian P-8 maritime patrol aircraft had been conducting monitoring flights in the region during the exercise period.

The European Union, whose collective foreign and security policy on Taiwan issues reflects the median of 27 member state positions ranging from Germany's economic caution to the Baltic states' security alarm, issued a statement calling for "de-escalation and dialogue" that several European foreign ministers privately described as inadequate to the seriousness of the situation. France's foreign minister, Stéphane Séjourné, issued a separate national statement that went further, calling the exercise "an unacceptable display of coercive force against a democratic society."

The domestic political context in both Beijing and Washington added layers of complexity to an already fraught situation. In Beijing, Xi Jinping's consolidated political authority means the exercise reflects deliberate strategic calculation rather than bureaucratic or factional pressure, and the question analysts were attempting to answer on Friday was what specific message the exercise was designed to convey and to whom. Several analysts argued it was primarily directed at Lai Ching-te's new government as a deterrent against further moves toward formal independence; others argued it was designed to test American response times and resolve; a third school of thought interpreted it as a demonstration for domestic audiences of China's military capability in the context of ongoing PLA modernisation narratives.

In Washington, the Trump administration's response has been constrained by its own strategic ambiguity about Taiwan — the administration has made rhetorical commitments to Taiwan's defence while simultaneously pursuing trade negotiations with Beijing that its officials regard as a separate track. A senior State Department official acknowledged on Friday that managing both relationships simultaneously "requires careful calibration" but insisted the administration's commitment to Taiwan's security was "unambiguous and unconditional." Chinese officials, in back-channel communications whose contents were described to Reuters by a person familiar with their substance, have reportedly told their American counterparts that the exercise was "not directed at the United States" but was a "necessary response to separatist provocation" — a formulation that American officials said they had received without accepting.

By Friday evening, PLA surface vessels had begun withdrawing from positions within Taiwan's contiguous zone, according to Taiwanese defence ministry tracking, though significant naval and air assets remained in the broader exercise area. Whether the 72-hour exercise was concluding or transitioning to a different phase was not immediately clear.

Financial markets reflected the anxiety with notable intensity. Taiwan's TAIEX stock index fell 4.8 percent on Friday in its worst single-day decline in fourteen months, with semiconductor stocks disproportionately affected given their role in global supply chain thinking about Taiwan contingency scenarios. The Taiwan dollar fell to its weakest level against the US dollar since 2016. In Tokyo, the Nikkei closed down 3.1 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 2.4 percent. The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index recorded its largest weekly decline since October 2023.

In Taipei, the public reaction combined alertness with the particular resilience of a population that has lived under military threat for seventy-five years and has developed a relationship with that threat that is neither paralysis nor indifference.

"This is serious," said one university student outside National Taiwan University on Friday afternoon. "It is also not the first time. We are still here."

The USS Carl Vinson's position as of Friday evening had not been publicly disclosed by US Indo-Pacific Command.
