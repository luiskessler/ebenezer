# Nigeria's Central Bank Halts Dollar Sales as Naira Slides Toward Historic Low Amid Oil Revenue Shortfall

**LAGOS, Feb. 21** — Nigeria's central bank suspended its weekly foreign exchange intervention sales to authorised dealer banks on Friday after its net usable reserves fell below a threshold that senior monetary officials privately described as the minimum required to maintain confidence in the naira's managed float, as the currency touched 1,847 to the dollar in early Lagos trading — within 3 percent of the historic low reached during last year's acute exchange rate crisis — driven by a combination of sharply reduced crude oil export revenues, accelerating capital outflows from the domestic bond market, and what a person familiar with the central bank's internal assessments described as a fundamental mismatch between dollar demand and dollar supply that intervention had been papering over for the better part of six weeks.

The Central Bank of Nigeria confirmed the suspension in a one-paragraph statement that cited "temporary operational adjustments to foreign exchange liquidity management" and gave no indication of when intervention sales would resume. The statement offered no figures on current reserve levels. An official at the CBN's financial markets department, speaking without authorisation, said net usable reserves — defined as gross reserves minus short-term liabilities including swap agreements and forward commitments — had fallen to approximately $6.1 billion, a figure that represents less than six weeks of import cover at current volumes and that analysts in Lagos described on Friday as dangerously thin for an economy of Nigeria's size and import dependence.

"This is a reserve adequacy crisis dressed up in the language of operational adjustment," said Bismarck Rewane, chief executive of the Lagos-based Financial Derivatives Company and one of Nigeria's most prominent independent economists. "When you stop intervening because you cannot afford to intervene, saying you have made an operational adjustment is technically accurate and fundamentally misleading."

The naira recovered marginally following the CBN statement, closing Friday's official market session at 1,831 — still down 4.2 percent on the week — as some participants interpreted the intervention suspension as a signal that the central bank was preparing to allow a sharper depreciation rather than defend a level it could no longer sustain. In the parallel market, which remains widely used despite successive government efforts to unify exchange rate tiers, the naira was quoted at 1,910 to the dollar by late afternoon, reflecting expectations of further official rate movement.

The immediate driver of the reserve depletion is a revenue shortfall from crude oil exports that has widened considerably since November. Nigeria, Africa's largest oil producer, pumps at levels chronically below its OPEC quota of approximately 1.5 million barrels per day due to persistent infrastructure deterioration, pipeline vandalism in the Niger Delta, and years of underinvestment in upstream capacity. Production figures released by the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission for January showed output of 1.31 million barrels per day, below even the downgraded expectations that analysts had factored into fiscal projections, and down from 1.47 million barrels per day in September.

Compounding the volume problem, global Brent crude prices have softened since December, falling from above $82 per barrel to approximately $74 on Friday, reducing the dollar value of each barrel Nigeria does export. The combined effect on government revenues — which depend on oil receipts for roughly half of their total — has been severe, with the Federation Account Allocation Committee distributing approximately 18 percent less to federal and state governments in January than in the corresponding month of 2025.

Finance Minister Wale Edun sought to project composure at a press briefing in Abuja on Friday, saying the government was "actively managing a challenging but not unprecedented external environment" and pointing to ongoing negotiations with the World Bank for a $1.5 billion development policy loan whose disbursement, he said, remained on track for the second quarter. He insisted Nigeria's macro-reform programme, launched by President Bola Tinubu when he took office in 2023 and centred on the removal of the fuel subsidy and the unification of exchange rates, remained fundamentally sound. "Reforms of this magnitude encounter turbulence," Edun said. "The answer is not to reverse them but to see them through."

The fuel subsidy removal, which Tinubu announced on his inauguration day in one of the most dramatic opening acts of any Nigerian presidency, eliminated a fiscal transfer that had cost the government an estimated 11 trillion naira annually but that had kept pump prices artificially low for Nigerian consumers. The removal drove an immediate and severe spike in transportation and food costs that fell disproportionately on lower-income households and that has sustained elevated inflation — currently running at 24.5 percent annually according to the National Bureau of Statistics — for nearly two years. Consumer purchasing power has contracted sharply, with the World Bank estimating last year that an additional 8 million Nigerians had fallen below the poverty line since the reform's implementation.

The exchange rate unification, the second pillar of the Tinubu reform agenda, attracted significant initial enthusiasm from foreign investors who had long demanded an end to the multiple-rate system that its predecessors had maintained. Foreign portfolio inflows into Nigerian treasury bills and bonds reached substantial levels in the second half of 2024 as investors took advantage of sharply positive real yields. Those same investors have been the source of the capital outflows now pressuring the naira, as risk appetite has shifted and dollar returns elsewhere have become more competitive. A senior portfolio manager at a London-based emerging markets fund, speaking informally, said his firm had reduced its Nigeria exposure by roughly 40 percent since December. "The reform story is real, but the execution risk is also real, and the reserve position doesn't give you a lot of room for error," he said.

The political pressure on Tinubu has intensified alongside the economic stress. Labour unions, which staged nationwide strikes over fuel prices and the cost of living in 2024, have signalled readiness to resume industrial action if economic conditions do not improve. Several state governors, particularly from opposition-aligned states in the northwest and southeast, have publicly called on the federal government to provide emergency relief funds for their constituents — requests that the federal government, facing its own revenue shortfall, has largely declined.

Despite the mounting difficulties, some economists cautioned against catastrophising. Yemi Kale, a former statistician-general of Nigeria now working in the private sector, noted that the country had navigated severe exchange rate crises before and that the CBN retained policy tools — including adjustments to monetary policy rate, which currently stands at 27.5 percent, and potential drawdowns on special purpose reserve instruments — that had not yet been deployed. "Nigeria has a way of looking like it is about to fall off a cliff and then not falling," he said. "That pattern is not a reason for complacency. But it is also not irrelevant."

The IMF, which concluded an Article IV consultation with Nigeria in November and at that time assessed the reform programme positively while flagging external vulnerability as a key risk, is understood to be monitoring developments closely. Whether Nigeria approaches the Fund for formal programme support — a step Tinubu's government has consistently resisted as politically toxic — may ultimately depend on how far reserves continue to fall in the coming weeks.

Currency traders said they expected significant volatility in the naira when markets opened Monday.
