Wildfires Force Mass Evacuation Across Chile's Coastal Valleys as Death Toll Climbs to 43

VALPARAÍSO, Feb. 21 — At least 43 people have been killed and more than 110,000 displaced across Chile's central coastal regions after a series of fast-moving wildfires, driven by record temperatures and sustained southerly winds, tore through densely populated hillside communities in and around Valparaíso and the Aconcagua Valley over the past four days, destroying an estimated 8,400 structures and leaving entire neighbourhoods reduced to ash and twisted metal.

The fires, which broke out simultaneously in multiple locations on Monday evening under conditions that authorities described as exceptional, continued to burn across an area exceeding 42,000 hectares as of Friday morning, with containment lines holding in some sectors but proving inadequate in others where wind shifts overnight had allowed several fronts to merge. President Gabriel Boric declared a state of catastrophe for the Valparaíso region on Tuesday and extended the designation to the O'Higgins region on Thursday as new ignitions were reported near the town of Rancagua, approximately 90 kilometres south of Santiago.

"This is the most destructive fire event in the recorded history of central Chile," said Ricardo Toro, national director of Chile's Emergency Management Agency, SENAPRED, at a briefing in Santiago on Friday. "We are not yet in a position to give a final figure on lives lost. Search operations in the most severely affected sectors are still ongoing."

The speed of the fires caught many residents without time to evacuate. Survivor accounts gathered by Chilean media described walls of flame moving through hillside settlements so rapidly that families fled on foot, abandoning vehicles gridlocked on narrow streets. At least six of the confirmed deaths involved individuals found inside cars that had been overtaken by fire before reaching evacuation routes, according to the Public Ministry, which has opened an investigation into the causes of the blazes and the adequacy of the emergency response.

A senior official within SENAPRED, speaking without authorisation to comment publicly on the investigation, said the agency had received a formal alert from the National Forestry Corporation, CONAF, on Monday afternoon warning that conditions in the coastal range were "extreme red" — the highest category in Chile's fire risk index — and that containment resources in the region had been pre-positioned accordingly. The official acknowledged, however, that the simultaneous outbreak of fires across multiple valleys had overwhelmed the available aerial assets within the first three hours. "We had the right protocols. What we did not have was enough aircraft in the right places at the right moment," the official said.

Questions about preparedness have sharpened amid allegations, reported by the Santiago-based newspaper La Tercera on Thursday, that budget constraints had prevented CONAF from renewing contracts for two heavy-lift air tankers whose leases expired in December. The government disputed the characterisation. Interior Minister Carolina Tohá insisted at a press conference on Friday that aerial firefighting capacity in central Chile had in fact increased compared with the previous fire season, though she acknowledged that demand during the current emergency had exceeded all pre-season projections.

The fires are unfolding against a backdrop of prolonged and worsening drought across Chile's central zone, where reservoirs in several river basins have reached historic lows following three consecutive years of below-average rainfall. Scientists have for several years identified central Chile as one of the regions globally most exposed to a compound climate risk: simultaneously increasing fire weather — hotter, drier, windier conditions during the austral summer — and declining water availability that weakens natural and managed landscapes' resilience to ignition.

Maisa Rojas, Chile's Environment Minister and a climate scientist who served as a lead author on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's sixth assessment report, said on Thursday that the current fires were "entirely consistent" with the trajectory projected in climate models for the region. "We have been saying for years that this is coming," she said. "The question now is not whether we believe the science. The question is what kind of country we are rebuilding, and whether we rebuild it in the same place and in the same way."

That question carries particular weight in Valparaíso, a UNESCO World Heritage city whose distinctive hillside barrios — informal and semi-formal settlements built across dozens of steep cerros overlooking the bay — have burned repeatedly in recent decades, most catastrophically in the April 2014 fires that killed 15 people and destroyed nearly 3,000 homes. Reconstruction after that event was slow and, critics argued, failed to address the underlying vulnerabilities: narrow access roads, dense wood construction, inadequate water pressure for firefighting in elevated sectors, and land tenure arrangements that complicate zoning enforcement.

Mario Flores, president of the Valparaíso regional chapter of the Chilean Chamber of Construction, said Friday that the industry stood ready to assist with reconstruction but warned against repeating past mistakes. "We cannot simply rebuild what was there," he said. "That would be a moral failure and a practical one." However, urban planning experts cautioned that the political pressure to return displaced families to their original land quickly would be intense, particularly in a city where affordable housing alternatives are severely limited.

International assistance has begun to arrive. Argentina dispatched two Canadair firefighting aircraft on Wednesday, and Spain confirmed on Thursday that it was sending a team of 45 specialist firefighters and four vehicles, expected to reach Valparaíso by Sunday. Brazil and Mexico have offered additional aerial support currently being coordinated through the region's civil protection network.

Chilean authorities said they expected the fires to remain active for at least another five to seven days, depending on forecast winds due to arrive from the Pacific over the weekend.
