# Democratic Republic of Congo Peace Initiative Stalls as M23 Advances on Bukavu and Regional Mediation Fractures

**KINSHASA, Feb. 21** — A regional ceasefire initiative for eastern Democratic Republic of Congo collapsed in acrimony on Friday after M23 rebel forces, backed according to a UN Group of Experts assessment by an estimated 3,500 to 4,000 Rwandan regular army troops operating without acknowledgement from Kigali, advanced to within 12 kilometres of Bukavu, the capital of South Kivu province and a city of approximately one million people, seizing the town of Kavumu and its strategically critical commercial airport in fighting that killed at least 47 civilians and displaced an estimated 200,000 people in the preceding 72 hours alone, in what United Nations officials described as the most significant territorial advance by the rebel coalition since its capture of Goma in late January.

The fall of Kavumu airport, confirmed by the UN peacekeeping mission MONUSCO and by multiple humanitarian organisations with staff in the area, eliminates the principal air corridor through which emergency humanitarian supplies had been reaching South Kivu's interior, where the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimates that 1.4 million people are in acute food insecurity and where cholera cases have risen sharply in displacement camps that have expanded beyond any designed capacity. Aid organisations said on Friday that they were assessing whether to implement emergency evacuation procedures for international staff in Bukavu.

"The humanitarian situation in South Kivu has moved from catastrophic to potentially unsurvivable for large numbers of civilians if access is not restored within days, not weeks," said David Carden, the UN's humanitarian coordinator for the DRC, in a statement released from Kinshasa on Friday. "We are not using that language to be dramatic. We are using it because it is accurate."

The collapse of the ceasefire initiative — brokered under the auspices of the East African Community and the Southern African Development Community in a joint mediation framework that had produced a fragile and repeatedly violated truce since December — came after the DRC government withdrew from scheduled talks in Kampala on Thursday, accusing Rwanda of having ordered the Kavumu offensive in deliberate bad faith while its representatives were seated at the negotiating table. Congolese Foreign Minister Thérèse Kayikwamba Wagner described the timing as "not a coincidence but a strategy: to negotiate with words while conquering with guns."

Rwanda's government denied any military presence in eastern DRC for the sixteenth time since the current phase of the conflict escalated in late 2024 and rejected what it called "baseless accusations designed to deflect attention from the Congolese government's own responsibility for the humanitarian crisis through its arming of the FDLR" — a reference to the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, a Hutu militia whose presence in eastern Congo and alleged collaboration with Congolese army units has been Rwanda's stated justification for what its officials describe as defensive support to the M23. The FDLR was founded by perpetrators of the 1994 Rwandan genocide, and Rwandan officials have argued consistently, if to limited international acceptance, that its continued presence in eastern Congo constitutes an existential security threat.

A member of the UN Group of Experts monitoring the DRC arms embargo, speaking on condition of strict anonymity because the group's formal report has not yet been published, said the evidence of Rwandan military involvement was "unambiguous and extensive" and included satellite imagery of Rwandan military equipment at forward positions, signals intercepts, and testimony from captured combatants. "The denial has become a formality," the expert said. "No serious analyst believes it."

The regional diplomatic picture has fractured along lines that complicate any coherent international response. Angola's President João Lourenço, who has invested significant personal diplomatic capital in a parallel mediation effort operating alongside the EAC-SADC framework, held emergency telephone calls on Friday with both DRC President Félix Tshisekedi and Rwandan President Paul Kagame in what Luanda described as an effort to prevent the situation from "crossing a threshold from which return becomes impossible." A senior Angolan foreign ministry official, reached by telephone in Luanda on Friday, said both leaders had agreed to remain in contact through the Angolan channel but that no concrete commitment to halt military operations had been obtained. "We are keeping the line open," the official said. "That is not nothing, but it is not enough."

South Africa, which has contributed troops to a SADC intervention force deployed to eastern Congo since late 2023 and which lost 13 soldiers in fighting near Goma in January, has been the most vocal African Union member state in attributing the conflict's escalation to Rwandan intervention. President Cyril Ramaphosa convened an emergency session of the South African National Security Council on Thursday evening and was expected to make a public statement on Saturday. Three South African soldiers attached to the SADC force were reported wounded in Friday's fighting near Kavumu, according to a defence ministry spokesperson in Pretoria, who said their conditions were stable.

The United States, whose annual security assistance to Rwanda runs to tens of millions of dollars and which has historically maintained close relations with Kagame's government despite repeated UN documentation of Rwandan activity in the DRC, issued a statement on Friday calling for "an immediate ceasefire and a return to dialogue" without explicitly naming Rwanda or referencing the UN experts' assessment of Rwandan troop involvement. Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's Africa subcommittee, published a statement that was considerably more direct, calling on the administration to suspend military assistance to Rwanda until it withdrew its forces from Congolese territory. "The evidence is not ambiguous," Coons said. "American taxpayer funds cannot be associated with this."

The European Union announced on Friday the suspension of €20 million in budgetary support to Rwanda pending "clarification of Rwanda's role in the current military operations in eastern DRC" — a step described by EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas as "not a punishment but a signal" and welcomed by human rights organisations as a meaningful departure from the bloc's previous reluctance to apply concrete consequences to Kigali. Rwanda's foreign ministry called the suspension "politically motivated and factually unwarranted."

In Bukavu itself, the mood on Friday was described by residents reached by telephone as one of fear calibrated by exhausted familiarity with cycles of violence that have devastated eastern Congo for three decades. Markets had closed, fuel prices had tripled overnight, and the main hospital was preparing to receive mass casualty transfers from Kavumu. A physician at a Médecins Sans Frontières facility in the city, who asked not to be named, said operating capacity was already at its limit before Friday's displacement wave. "We have been at our limit for months," she said. "What is coming toward us now is beyond what we can absorb."

The UN Security Council is scheduled to hold an emergency session on the DRC on Monday, the fourth such emergency session in six weeks, at which Western members are expected to press for a resolution demanding immediate ceasefire and Rwandan withdrawal. Whether Russia and China, both of which have blocked previous draft resolutions containing explicit language on Rwandan involvement, would permit a substantive text to pass remained deeply uncertain.

MONUSCO, whose mandate was extended by the Security Council in December but whose operational capacity has been severely strained by the pace and scale of the current offensive, confirmed on Friday that its forces had not engaged M23 or Rwandan units during the Kavumu fighting, a decision that drew fierce public criticism from Congolese civil society organisations who accused the mission of abandoning its civilian protection mandate. A MONUSCO spokesperson said the force's rules of engagement required specific conditions for offensive action that had not been met and that the mission had prioritised the evacuation of civilians where its resources allowed.

How much longer those resources would prove adequate, given the direction of travel on the ground, was a question that no one in Kinshasa, Bukavu, or New York on Friday afternoon could answer with confidence.
