# Brazil's Amazon Enforcement Agency Faces Dismemberment as Congress Advances Bill to Strip Inspection Powers

**BRASÍLIA, Feb. 21** — Brazil's Congress moved a bill through its environment committee on Friday that would transfer the primary enforcement authority for illegal deforestation, land grabbing, and environmental licensing violations in the Amazon basin from Ibama — the federal environmental agency whose field inspectors have for decades served as the principal institutional barrier between the world's largest tropical rainforest and the interests seeking to exploit it — to a newly created body subordinate to the agriculture ministry, a structural change that environmental scientists, indigenous rights organisations, and international conservation groups described on Friday as the most consequential institutional attack on Amazon governance since Brazil's Forest Code was weakened in 2012, and one whose timing, in the middle of a presidential election campaign in which the agrarian caucus has emerged as the decisive parliamentary power broker, was not, analysts said, coincidental.

The bill, authored by Senator Marcos Rogério of the Democrats party and backed by the bancada ruralista — the powerful agrarian caucus that holds approximately a third of seats in both chambers of the National Congress and whose members represent the agricultural and ranching interests that have been the primary drivers of Amazon deforestation for half a century — passed the Senate Environment and Consumer Affairs Committee by a vote of fourteen to nine on Friday afternoon, with no members of the ruling Workers' Party coalition voting in favour and all members of the opposition PL and União Brasil blocs voting to advance it. It now proceeds to the full Senate floor, where its sponsors said they expected a vote within three weeks.

The bill's supporters argue that Ibama's enforcement model has been economically destructive and legally arbitrary, imposing fines and operational embargos on legitimate agricultural enterprises based on what they characterise as ideologically driven inspectors applying rules inconsistently. Senator Marcos Rogério told the committee on Friday that transferring enforcement authority to the agriculture ministry would create "a regulatory environment that treats Brazilian producers as partners in sustainable development rather than presumptive criminals." He cited data showing that Ibama's fine collection rate — the proportion of assessed penalties that are actually paid — runs below 3 percent, arguing the agency's enforcement model was ineffective as well as economically harmful.

Environmental lawyers and the Ibama inspectors' union contested those figures and their interpretation vigorously. Suely Araújo, a former Ibama president and now a senior specialist at the Climate Observatory think tank in São Paulo, said on Friday that the low collection rate reflected not Ibama's failure but the agrarian caucus's success in embedding legal challenges and payment deferrals into the fine contestation process over successive legislative cycles. "They have spent twenty years making the fines impossible to collect and are now citing that impossibility as evidence that the agency doesn't work," she said. "It is a remarkable performance."

The bill arrives at a moment of significant political complexity for President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, whose third-term administration took office in January 2023 having made the reversal of Jair Bolsonaro's deforestation surge a central campaign commitment and who has since claimed meaningful success on that front: deforestation rates in the Legal Amazon fell 50 percent in 2023 compared with 2022, according to Brazil's National Institute for Space Research, and continued to decline in 2024, achievements for which the administration has received significant international recognition including a $500 million disbursement from Norway and Germany's Amazon Fund.

Those achievements now risk being institutionally undermined by a Congress whose agrarian caucus Lula has simultaneously relied upon to pass economic legislation unrelated to the environment, creating a political dependency that has limited the executive's willingness to confront the bancada ruralista on land use questions. A senior government official in the presidential palace, speaking without authorisation, acknowledged the contradiction with visible discomfort. "We are governing in the real world, not in a seminar," the official said. "The relationships that allow us to function as a government are the same relationships that create constraints we would rather not have."

Environment Minister Marina Silva, the internationally celebrated conservationist who served in Lula's first government, resigned in 2008 over deforestation policy disagreements, and returned to the portfolio in 2023 as perhaps the most prominent symbol of the administration's environmental commitments, has been the bill's most vocal executive opponent. She issued a statement on Friday describing it as "a frontal assault on the legal and institutional architecture that protects the Amazon" and announcing that the government would oppose it at every legislative stage and would veto it if it reached Lula's desk in its current form. The veto pledge was notable: Lula himself has not yet publicly addressed the bill, a silence that observers interpreted as reflecting the political delicacy of openly confronting the agrarian caucus whose votes he needs.

Whether the veto threat is credible depends on political calculations that will evolve as the 2026 presidential election, scheduled for October, approaches. Lula, who will be 81 by election day and whose health has been the subject of recurring speculation following a brain surgery in December 2024, has not yet formally confirmed he will seek a fourth term. Several potential successors within the PT are watching the environmental policy space carefully, as international climate finance — of which Brazil is now one of the world's largest recipients — has become a significant element of the country's development financing, creating economic incentives for maintaining environmental governance that sit alongside the political pressures pushing in the opposite direction.

The international community has watched the bill's progress with alarm. Norway's climate and environment minister issued a statement on Friday saying Oslo was "following the legislative process in Brazil's Congress with great concern" and that the Norwegian government would need to assess the implications for its continued Amazon Fund contributions if enforcement authority was transferred in ways that compromised the effectiveness of deforestation control. Germany's development ministry issued a parallel statement in nearly identical terms. The two countries have together contributed approximately $1.4 billion to the Amazon Fund since its reconstitution in 2023.

A senior European Commission official, speaking privately, said Brussels was "in active discussion" with member state governments about whether a coordinated European response to the bill's passage would be appropriate if it proceeded to enactment, including whether it would affect implementation of the EU-Mercosur trade agreement whose ratification has already been delayed for years by European concerns about Brazilian agricultural and environmental standards.

Indigenous organisations whose territories overlap with areas most affected by illegal deforestation and land grabbing described the bill in terms of physical as well as institutional threat. Sônia Guajajara, Brazil's minister for indigenous peoples — herself a member of the Guajajara people of Maranhão — said the transfer of enforcement authority to the agriculture ministry would expose indigenous land boundaries to "systematic invasion without effective state response" and described the bill as "a declaration of open season on our territories."

Dinamam Tuxá, executive coordinator of the Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil, said in a statement that his organisation was mobilising indigenous communities across the Amazon basin for what he described as a sustained campaign of public resistance, including planned demonstrations in Brasília timed to coincide with the full Senate vote. "They are trying to do in a committee vote what they could not do openly," he said. "We will make sure the world sees what they are attempting."

The full Senate vote is expected in the second week of March. Environmental organisations said they were exploring legal challenges before the Supreme Federal Tribunal should the bill pass both chambers.
