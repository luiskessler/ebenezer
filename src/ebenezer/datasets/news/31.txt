# Sri Lanka's Debt Restructuring Unravels as Bondholder Group Rejects Revised Terms and Rupee Slides

**COLOMBO, Feb. 21** — Sri Lanka's painstakingly negotiated exit from the worst economic crisis in its post-independence history threatened to collapse on Friday after an ad hoc group representing holders of approximately $6.8 billion in international sovereign bonds formally rejected the government's revised restructuring terms in a letter delivered to the finance ministry on Thursday evening, citing what the group described as a fundamental inconsistency between the debt relief being offered to private creditors and the terms agreed separately with bilateral official creditors — principally China, India, and the Paris Club grouping of Western government lenders — that the bondholders argued violated the comparability of treatment principle that underpins all sovereign debt restructuring frameworks.

The rejection, whose contents were confirmed to journalists on Friday by two people who had reviewed the letter, comes twenty-two months after Sri Lanka reached a staff-level agreement with the International Monetary Fund on a $2.9 billion bailout programme, and fourteen months after the government announced what it described as a breakthrough agreement in principle with its official creditor group. The bondholder group's refusal to accept terms consistent with that agreement threatens to unravel a restructuring process that the IMF, the Sri Lankan government, and most external observers had cautiously characterised in recent months as approaching resolution, and raises the prospect of Sri Lanka returning to or remaining in a state of effective default on its external commercial debt that would continue to limit its access to international capital markets and constrain its economic recovery.

"This is a serious and unexpected setback," said Murtaza Jafferjee, chairman of the Colombo-based Advocata Institute and one of Sri Lanka's most prominent independent economists, speaking by telephone on Friday. "The government had been telling its domestic audience and international partners that the restructuring was essentially complete. That narrative has now been significantly complicated."

The bondholder group's core objection, articulated in the letter and elaborated by a spokesperson for the group's legal advisers, Cleary Gottlieb Steen and Hamilton, in a brief statement on Friday, concerns what the bondholders characterise as preferential treatment extended to China's Export-Import Bank in its bilateral agreement with Colombo. Specifically, the group alleges that the interest rate terms and grace period provisions in the China ExIm agreement, when their net present value is calculated using the discount rate methodology agreed as part of the IMF programme framework, produce a smaller debt relief contribution from Beijing relative to its exposure than private creditors are being asked to absorb — a disparity that the bondholders say makes the terms they have been offered incompatible with internationally accepted restructuring norms.

The Sri Lankan government categorically rejected the analysis. Finance Minister Shehan Semasinghe said at a press conference in Colombo on Friday afternoon that the government's calculations, verified by independent financial advisers and reviewed by the IMF, demonstrated full comparability of treatment across creditor classes. He accused the bondholder group of deploying a disputed methodology to justify demands for better terms and warned that the government would not offer additional concessions that would compromise the fiscal space required for economic recovery. "Sri Lanka has come too far and suffered too much to be held hostage by a creditor group pursuing narrow commercial interests at the expense of the Sri Lankan people," he said.

The IMF, whose programme disbursements have continued during the restructuring process subject to quarterly reviews, issued a careful statement on Friday saying it remained "engaged with all parties" and urging a "swift and collaborative resolution" without characterising the merits of the comparability dispute. A person familiar with the Fund's internal assessment, speaking on condition of anonymity, said IMF staff were genuinely uncertain whether the bondholder group's comparability argument had technical merit or was primarily a negotiating position, and that the Fund was commissioning its own independent analysis of the competing present value calculations — a process expected to take two to three weeks.

The comparability of treatment question has been a recurring source of friction in sovereign debt restructuring globally, and China's bilateral debt agreements have been a particular source of tension in multiple recent restructurings, including Zambia and Ghana, where creditor committees spent months disputing whether Chinese terms met the standard required for private creditors to accept comparable relief. In each of those cases, resolution ultimately required extended negotiation and, in some instances, renegotiation of the Chinese bilateral terms — a process that Chinese authorities have historically approached with considerable reluctance and that Colombo is now being told may be necessary again.

China's embassy in Colombo did not respond to a request for comment on Friday. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson in Beijing said China had "always fulfilled its international responsibilities in good faith" in sovereign debt matters and that its agreement with Sri Lanka had been reached "through fair and transparent negotiation" — language that stopped well short of engaging with the specific comparability allegations.

India, which provided crucial bilateral swap lines and bridge financing to Sri Lanka during the acute phase of the 2022 crisis when the country's foreign exchange reserves were exhausted, and whose Export-Import Bank is separately party to the bilateral creditor agreement, has watched the bondholder dispute with a combination of strategic interest and concern. New Delhi's relationship with Colombo has deepened significantly during the crisis period, reflecting India's broader interest in limiting Chinese influence in an island nation whose geographic position at the centre of Indian Ocean shipping lanes makes it a significant strategic prize. A senior Indian foreign ministry official, reached by telephone on Friday, declined to comment specifically on the restructuring dispute but noted that India remained "fully committed to Sri Lanka's economic recovery and stability."

The economic consequences of continued restructuring uncertainty are felt most acutely by ordinary Sri Lankans who lived through the 2022 crisis — characterised by fuel queues stretching for kilometres, lengthy power cuts, acute medicine shortages, and a political explosion that saw protesters storm and briefly occupy the presidential palace, driving then-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to flee the country and resign. That crisis, rooted in a combination of irresponsible fiscal policy, heavy external borrowing in the preceding decade, and the catastrophic impact of COVID-19 on tourism revenues, produced an economic contraction of nearly 8 percent in 2022 and inflation that peaked above 70 percent.

The recovery since has been genuine if incomplete. Growth returned in 2023, inflation has fallen to single digits, and the government has implemented significant fiscal consolidation — including deeply unpopular tax increases and subsidy reductions — that has restored a degree of macroeconomic stability. Tourism receipts have recovered strongly, reaching approximately $2.7 billion in 2024, and remittances from the Sri Lankan diaspora have remained resilient. The rupee had stabilised after its catastrophic depreciation in 2022 and had appreciated modestly against the dollar through late 2024 — a trend that reversed sharply on Friday, with the currency falling 2.8 percent to 305 to the dollar as news of the bondholder rejection circulated through Colombo's financial markets.

The Colombo Stock Exchange's All Share Price Index fell 3.4 percent on Friday, its largest single-day decline in eleven months, with bank stocks particularly hard hit given the domestic financial sector's exposure to government securities whose valuation is partly contingent on the external debt restructuring's completion.

Whether the bondholder group's rejection represents a final position or an opening move in a further negotiation is the question that government officials, IMF staff, and market participants were attempting to assess on Friday. Sovereign debt advisers with experience in comparable situations said the letter's language — asserting a principled comparability objection rather than simply demanding better economics — was consistent with a group that believed it had a legitimate legal and technical argument and intended to press it seriously, but was also consistent with a negotiating posture designed to extract improved terms before a final agreement.

"The question is whether they actually believe their own comparability analysis or whether they are using it as leverage," said one restructuring adviser with direct experience of comparable situations, speaking informally. "The answer to that question determines everything about how this resolves."

Formal talks between government representatives and the bondholder group's advisers were expected to resume in London next week.
