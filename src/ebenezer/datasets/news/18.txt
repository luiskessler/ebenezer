# Surge in Measles Cases Across Western Europe Prompts WHO Emergency Coordination as Vaccine Hesitancy Reaches Decade High

**GENEVA, Feb. 21** — The World Health Organization's European regional office convened an emergency coordination meeting in Copenhagen on Friday after measles infections across seventeen western European countries reached 23,400 confirmed cases in the first seven weeks of 2026 — a figure that exceeds the total for all of 2024 and that the organisation's epidemiologists described as the steepest acceleration in measles transmission recorded in the European region since the disease was declared eliminated in the majority of member states between 2007 and 2014, a status that several countries now risk formally losing under WHO's own elimination criteria.

The outbreak, which has been most severe in France, Romania, Germany, and Italy but has recorded significant case clusters in Belgium, Austria, the Netherlands, and as far north as Sweden, has killed seven people — four children under the age of five and three immunocompromised adults — and hospitalised more than 1,800, with intensive care units in several affected cities reporting measles-related admissions at levels that senior clinicians described as unlike anything they had encountered in their professional lifetimes. Encephalitis, the most feared complication of measles infection, has been confirmed in 23 cases, of which six have resulted in permanent neurological damage according to preliminary assessments.

"We are watching the consequence of accumulated immunity gaps play out in real time," said Dr. Hans Kluge, WHO Regional Director for Europe, at a press briefing in Copenhagen on Friday. "This is not a mystery. We know why this is happening. And we know what stops it. The tragedy is that the tools to prevent every one of these deaths and every one of these cases of brain damage exist, are safe, and are freely available in virtually every country affected."

The measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, which requires two doses to confer approximately 97 percent protection and which has been part of routine childhood immunisation schedules across Europe for decades, has seen coverage rates decline in a significant number of countries since the COVID-19 pandemic. Disruptions to routine immunisation services during lockdown periods created cohorts of unvaccinated children in 2020 and 2021 whose protection gaps have accumulated as those children have entered pre-school and primary school settings where transmission occurs rapidly. Compounding that structural deficit, vaccine hesitancy rates across several European countries have risen to their highest recorded levels, driven in part by the spread of anti-vaccination content through social media platforms and in part by residual distrust of public health institutions generated by controversies over pandemic management.

A Eurobarometer survey published last month found that 19 percent of respondents across EU member states agreed with the statement that childhood vaccines cause more harm than benefit — up from 11 percent in 2019 — with particularly high hesitancy rates recorded in France, where 31 percent of respondents expressed such agreement, and in Romania, where the figure reached 38 percent. Those two countries account for approximately 60 percent of current European measles cases.

France's public health authority, Santé Publique France, reported on Thursday that the current outbreak had spread to 87 of the country's 101 departments and that case counts were doubling approximately every 16 days — a transmission rate indicating a reproductive number well above the threshold at which herd immunity, requiring roughly 95 percent population coverage, could contain spread. The French government announced on Friday a national measles response plan that includes free catch-up vaccination at pharmacies without prescription requirement, mandatory reporting of cases within 24 hours by all healthcare providers, and a new public communication campaign whose creative strategy, officials said, had been deliberately designed to address hesitancy rather than simply reassure already-vaccinated populations.

Health Minister Geneviève Darrieussecq insisted France's vaccination infrastructure remained sound. However, Dr. Arnaud Fontanet, an epidemiologist at the Institut Pasteur in Paris, warned that the communication campaign, though well-designed, was unlikely to move hesitant populations quickly enough to interrupt the current transmission chain. "You cannot communicate your way out of an outbreak at this stage," he said. "You need vaccination rates to increase within weeks, and behaviour change of that speed requires something beyond messaging — it requires structural intervention."

Romania presents a more acute version of the same problem, complicated by severe healthcare infrastructure constraints. The country has the lowest vaccination coverage rate in the EU, with MMR first-dose coverage estimated at 77 percent nationally and considerably lower in rural and Roma communities where historical marginalisation from healthcare services has produced profound institutional distrust. A UNICEF emergency mission arrived in Bucharest on Monday to support the Romanian health ministry's outbreak response, with particular focus on reaching underserved communities through mobile vaccination units and community health workers.

The role of social media platforms in amplifying vaccine misinformation has drawn renewed regulatory attention. The European Commission issued a formal request on Friday under the Digital Services Act to four major platforms — Meta, TikTok, YouTube, and X — seeking detailed information about the reach and engagement metrics of anti-vaccination content on their services over the past six months and the actions each platform had taken to limit its spread. The DSA, which came into full effect in February 2024, requires very large online platforms to assess and mitigate systemic risks including risks to public health, and the Commission's request was framed as a preliminary step toward determining whether formal enforcement action was warranted.

A spokesperson for Meta said the company "takes the spread of health misinformation seriously" and had "robust systems" for reducing the distribution of content that contradicted public health guidance. X did not respond to a request for comment by the time of publication. Digital rights advocates cautioned that platform enforcement against health misinformation, while potentially beneficial, raised its own questions about the boundaries of permissible speech that deserved careful legal consideration.

The outbreak has also exposed fault lines in European cross-border public health coordination that the COVID-19 pandemic was supposed to have prompted governments to address. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the EU's disease monitoring agency, has tracked the outbreak's progression in real time and issued multiple rapid risk assessments since December, but its mandate does not extend to directing national public health responses or coordinating cross-border vaccination campaigns in the way that many epidemiologists believe the situation requires.

Dr. Pamela Rendi-Wagner, ECDC director, said on Friday that the agency was providing technical support to all affected member states and was facilitating information sharing at a pace and granularity that had not been possible before the agency's post-pandemic capacity expansion. She acknowledged, however, that coordination between national responses remained "suboptimal" and that several affected countries had been slow to share genomic sequencing data that would help clarify transmission chains across borders. "We are better than we were in 2020," she said. "We are not yet as good as we need to be."

The seven deaths recorded so far have each generated significant media coverage in their respective countries, and public health officials expressed hope that the human reality of the outbreak — its impact on children, on families — might prove more persuasive to hesitant populations than statistical arguments about vaccine safety and efficacy had managed to be. Whether that hope is founded will become apparent in the vaccination uptake data expected from national health authorities over the coming fortnight.

WHO's Copenhagen office said it would reconvene the emergency coordination group weekly until case counts showed a sustained downward trend.
