# Iran-Backed Militia Network Fractures in Iraq as US Strikes Kill Senior Commander and Baghdad Faces Governance Crisis

**BAGHDAD, Feb. 21** — A United States drone strike in the early hours of Friday morning killed a senior commander of Kataib Hezbollah, one of the most powerful Iranian-backed militias operating within Iraq's Popular Mobilisation Forces umbrella, in the Jurf al-Sakhar district south of Baghdad — an operation that American Central Command confirmed within three hours of the strike and that triggered a cascade of consequences across Iraq's fractured political landscape, exposing in sharp relief the fundamental contradiction at the heart of the Iraqi state: a government in Baghdad that is simultaneously a formal American security partner and the nominal political authority over armed factions whose strategic direction comes from Tehran and whose tolerance of American military action on Iraqi soil has reached a point that senior Iraqi officials described on Friday as categorically exhausted.

The killed commander, identified by CENTCOM as Abu Haider al-Lami — whose real name Iraqi security sources gave as Qassem Farhan Hamid — was described by American officials as having overseen the planning and logistics of drone and rocket attacks against American personnel and facilities in Iraq and Syria over the past eighteen months, including an attack in November that wounded four American soldiers at a facility in western Anbar province. CENTCOM said the strike had been authorised under the standing authority to conduct self-defence operations against threats to American forces and characterised it as "precise and deliberate," with no civilian casualties.

Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia' al-Sudani, whose political survival depends on maintaining workable relationships with both Washington and the PMF factions whose electoral weight and armed capacity make them indispensable to governance in Baghdad, convened an emergency cabinet session within two hours of the strike's confirmation and issued a statement describing it as "a blatant violation of Iraqi sovereignty and a dangerous escalation that the government of Iraq categorically rejects." His foreign ministry summoned the American chargé d'affaires — the United States Embassy has been without a confirmed ambassador for seven months — to deliver a formal protest. By Friday afternoon, Sudani had also received a telephone call from Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, the contents of which were not disclosed but which Iraqi officials said had lasted forty-five minutes.

The response from the PMF factions was angrier and more explicit. Hadi al-Amiri, the most powerful PMF political figure and head of the Badr Organisation, said at a press conference in Baghdad that the strike represented "a declaration of open season on the resistance" and warned that American forces in Iraq faced consequences that he declined to specify. Qais al-Khazali, leader of Asaib Ahl al-Haq and a figure whose relationship with both the Iraqi state and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps has defined the outer limits of what Baghdad can tolerate from PMF rhetoric without institutional consequence, issued a statement calling for the "immediate and unconditional departure of all American forces from Iraqi soil" — a demand that has been made repeatedly for years and that has been consistently unrealised.

The political landscape within which this strike occurred is significantly more complex than the binary American-Iranian proxy confrontation that media shorthand often implies. The PMF is not a monolithic structure, and the past year has seen significant internal fracturing along lines that divide factions more closely aligned with Iran's direct strategic direction from those whose primary loyalty runs to Iraqi nationalist interests that are compatible with Iranian influence but not identical to it. Abu Haider al-Lami was, according to three Iraqi security officials who spoke on condition of anonymity, precisely the kind of commander whose operations had been a source of tension even within parts of the PMF, because his attacks on American targets had periodically threatened to trigger retaliatory strikes that caused collateral damage to PMF facilities and personnel whose commanders had not authorised the original provocations.

A senior official within the Iraqi National Intelligence Service, speaking with extreme caution and without authorisation, said the service had been aware of increased American surveillance of al-Lami's movements for several weeks and had "not intervened to obstruct" that surveillance — language that fell well short of explicit cooperation but that the official acknowledged carried clear implications. "Iraq is not a simple country," the official said. "There are things that happen here that serve multiple interests simultaneously, and the public positions and the operational realities are not always the same thing."

The American strike arrived in the context of a broader reassessment of the United States military presence in Iraq that the Trump administration has been conducting since taking office in January. The ongoing negotiations between Baghdad and Washington over the future of American forces in Iraq — nominally guest forces operating under a security framework agreement whose renegotiation has been under discussion since the Iraqi parliament passed a non-binding resolution demanding their departure following the American killing of Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani and PMF deputy commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis in January 2020 — have been characterised by American officials as "productive but unresolved" and by Iraqi officials as "moving toward an agreed transition timeline" whose specifics remained contested.

The strike complicates that negotiation in ways that both sides acknowledged on Friday were significant. A senior American official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the administration's position was that the right to conduct self-defence operations against direct threats to American personnel was not subject to negotiation and would not be sacrificed in any agreement on troop presence. Iraqi negotiators have privately argued that an American military footprint whose operations include unilateral lethal strikes against armed factions that are formally part of Iraq's state security architecture is not a presence that any Iraqi government can politically sustain indefinitely.

The Iranian response was calibrated rather than immediate. The Foreign Ministry in Tehran issued a statement condemning the strike and warning of "regional consequences of American aggression" without specifying any concrete measures. Analysts of Iranian foreign policy noted that Tehran's management of the PMF factions it most closely directs has become more cautious since the October 7th Hamas attack triggered a sequence of events — including the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in September last year and the significant degradation of Iranian-backed armed networks across the region — that has led Iranian strategic planners to recalibrate the risk calculus of direct confrontation with American forces.

The domestic political consequences in Baghdad were felt with particular acuity on Friday because Sudani's government was simultaneously managing a separate governance crisis involving the resignation of his finance minister over disputes about the 2025 budget, whose passage through the Council of Representatives has been delayed for six weeks by disagreements between Kurdish, Sunni, and Shia political blocs over revenue sharing formulas and the allocation of reconstruction funds. The budget impasse had been the principal item on Sudani's political agenda before Friday's strike redirected attention in ways that complicated rather than simplified his position.

Kurdish political leaders in Erbil, whose relationship with American forces in the Kurdistan Region is qualitatively different from the Baghdad dynamic and who have watched the erosion of the American presence in Iraq with considerable concern about its implications for their own security, issued a statement of measured language on Friday expressing support for the principle of protection of coalition personnel while urging all parties to "pursue political solutions that preserve stability."

Sunni political figures in Anbar and Nineveh, whose constituencies have historical memories of both American military operations and PMF excesses that complicate any simple political alignment, were largely silent on Friday — a silence that veteran observers of Iraqi politics interpreted as the particular caution of communities that have learned from experience that taking public positions in moments of acute factional tension carries consequences whose direction cannot be predicted.

In Baghdad's streets, the public reaction on Friday mixed the particular fatigue of a population that has lived through cycles of violence, foreign intervention, and political crisis for more than two decades with a genuine anxiety about whether the current moment represents a manageable escalation or the beginning of a more dangerous deterioration.

"We have seen this before," said one university lecturer in central Baghdad, reached by telephone on Friday afternoon and declining to be identified. "Someone is killed, statements are made, there are protests, and then it becomes the new normal. Unless it doesn't. And you never know which it will be until it is too late to change it."

American forces at the Ain al-Asad air base in Anbar and at other Iraqi facilities were reported to have elevated their force protection posture following the strike. No attacks on American personnel had been reported as of Friday evening.
