# Spain's Ruling Coalition Fractures Over Amnesty Law Implementation as Catalan Separatist Party Withdraws Budget Support

**MADRID, Feb. 21** — Spain's minority government faced the most serious threat to its parliamentary survival since taking office fourteen months ago on Friday, after Junts per Catalunya, the Catalan separatist party whose seven deputies have provided Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez's coalition with its working majority in the Congress of Deputies, announced it was suspending its support for the government's 2025 budget bill with immediate effect, citing what the party's secretary-general Jordi Turull described as the executive's "systematic failure" to implement the terms of the amnesty law passed last June in a manner consistent with the political agreement that secured Junts's support for Sánchez's investiture in November 2023.

The withdrawal, announced at a press conference in Barcelona on Friday morning, does not automatically trigger a government collapse — Spain's constitution makes it difficult to remove a sitting prime minister through a simple withdrawal of confidence — but it leaves Sánchez without the votes to pass a budget for the second consecutive year, deepening the fiscal paralysis that has seen the country operate under extended versions of previous budgets since 2022 and drawing fresh warnings from European Commission economists about the sustainability of Spain's public finances at a time when Brussels is reasserting deficit reduction requirements suspended during the pandemic era.

"The government has had fourteen months to demonstrate good faith," Turull said in Barcelona. "What we have seen instead is a law that exists on paper and a reality that contradicts it at every turn. Junts will not continue to provide cover for an administration that does not honour its commitments."

Sánchez responded from the Moncloa palace in Madrid with barely concealed anger, accusing Junts of "hostage politics" and suggesting the party's decision was driven by internal pressures and the forthcoming Catalan regional electoral cycle rather than by genuine grievances about amnesty implementation. "This government passed a historic amnesty law," he said. "Its application is a matter for independent judicial institutions, not for political negotiation." He did not indicate he planned to call early elections.

The amnesty law, which passed the Congress of Deputies in June after months of tortured legislative maneuvering, was designed to extinguish criminal and administrative liability for acts connected to Catalonia's 2017 independence referendum and the political crisis that followed, benefiting several hundred individuals including former regional president Carles Puigdemont, who has lived in self-imposed exile in Belgium since fleeing Spain in October 2017 to avoid prosecution. The law's passage was immediately challenged before the Constitutional Court by the conservative Partido Popular and the far-right Vox, and several provisions remain subject to ongoing judicial interpretation.

The specific implementation disputes that have driven Junts to act involve a series of decisions by Spanish courts, including the Supreme Court, that Junts argues have applied the law's provisions in an excessively restrictive manner, effectively maintaining legal exposure for individuals the party contends the law was intended to protect. The Supreme Court last month declined to apply the amnesty to certain financial charges related to the 2017 referendum on the grounds that they fell outside the law's scope — a ruling that Turull described on Friday as "a judicial veto of a democratic legislative decision."

Puigdemont himself, who retains significant influence over Junts's strategic decisions despite his continuing absence from Spanish territory, published a statement on the platform X on Friday endorsing the budget suspension and describing the amnesty implementation as "a betrayal dressed in legal language."

The Constitutional Court is currently deliberating on the challenges to the law and is expected to issue a ruling in the coming months. A senior government legal adviser, speaking without authorisation, said the administration remained confident the court would ultimately uphold the law's core provisions, but acknowledged the timeline was outside the government's control. "We cannot dictate to the judiciary," the adviser said. "That is precisely the point."

The political consequences of Friday's announcement extend well beyond the budget. Sánchez's legislative agenda for the remainder of the parliamentary term — which runs until late 2027 unless he calls early elections — depends on assembling fragile majority coalitions for each individual measure from a heterogeneous bloc of regional nationalist parties, left-wing formations, and the junior coalition partner Sumar, whose relationship with the larger PSOE has itself shown signs of strain in recent months over labour and housing policy. The loss of Junts's reliable support makes that arithmetic considerably more difficult.

Alberto Núñez Feijóo, the PP leader and leader of the opposition, called on Sánchez to resign and convene fresh elections, arguing that a government unable to pass a budget had forfeited its democratic mandate. "Spain cannot be governed through permanent improvisation," he said at a PP parliamentary group meeting in Madrid on Friday. Sánchez's allies dismissed the call as opportunistic, noting that the PP had itself governed without approved budgets for extended periods during previous administrations.

The economic backdrop adds urgency to the political impasse. Spain's economy has outperformed most of the eurozone in recent years, growing at approximately 3.2 percent in 2024 according to preliminary government estimates, driven by strong tourism revenue, a resilient labour market, and significant inflows of EU recovery funds. However, the European Commission's autumn fiscal assessment warned that Spain's structural deficit remained above the targets agreed under the reformed EU fiscal rules, and that without a credible medium-term fiscal plan — which requires an approved budget — the Commission could initiate a formal excessive deficit procedure that would constrain public spending and carry significant political embarrassment.

Nadia Calviño, Spain's former economy minister who now serves as president of the European Investment Bank, declined to comment on the domestic political situation. However, economists at BBVA Research and the FUNCAS think tank both issued notes on Friday warning that prolonged budget paralysis carried real macroeconomic costs, particularly for public investment programmes dependent on annual appropriations.

Whether Junts's withdrawal is a negotiating manoeuvre or a genuine rupture remained the central question in Madrid's political circles on Friday evening. The party has previously escalated its demands to the brink of crisis and then reached accommodation, a pattern that has led some PSOE strategists to treat Friday's announcement with cautious scepticism. Others within the government, however, described the mood as qualitatively different from previous confrontations.

"There have been moments before when we thought they were serious and they weren't," one government official said privately. "There have also been moments when we thought they were bluffing and they weren't. I am not certain which this is."

Sánchez is expected to hold consultations with coalition partners over the weekend. No emergency parliamentary session has been called.
