# Greek Authorities Investigate Systemic Fraud at National Maritime Registry as EU Shipping Funds Implicated

**ATHENS, Feb. 21** — Greek prosecutors opened a formal criminal investigation on Friday into alleged large-scale fraud at the Hellenic Register of Shipping, the state body responsible for certifying the seaworthiness and regulatory compliance of vessels flying the Greek flag — the world's largest merchant fleet by tonnage — after an internal whistleblower submitted documentation to the Supreme Court prosecutor's office alleging that safety certificates had been issued systematically to vessels that had not undergone the physical inspections those certificates attested to, with preliminary estimates suggesting the scheme may have touched as many as 400 ships over a five-year period.

The investigation, confirmed in a statement from the Athens Prosecutor's Office on Friday afternoon, targets both senior registry officials and a network of private classification surveyors whose firms are contracted by the Hellenic Register to conduct vessel inspections on its behalf. Prosecutors have issued orders freezing assets belonging to eleven individuals and have requested cooperation from maritime authorities in Cyprus, Malta, Panama, and Liberia — all major flag states with which the Hellenic Register has reciprocal certification agreements whose integrity may have been compromised by the alleged fraud.

The case has sent immediate tremors through the European shipping finance community. Greek-owned and Greek-flagged vessels are heavily collateralised across major European shipping loan books, and several of the ships identified in preliminary prosecutor documents as potentially carrying fraudulent safety certificates are understood to be financed through facilities extended by Greek, German, and Norwegian banks. Shares in two Athens-listed shipping holding companies fell more than 9 percent on Friday before trading was briefly suspended by the Athens Stock Exchange's automated circuit breaker mechanism.

The whistleblower, identified in court documents only as a former senior certification officer at the Hellenic Register with seventeen years of service, alleged in a 340-page submission that the scheme operated through a tiered kickback structure in which shipowners or their technical managers paid fees — ranging from €15,000 to €180,000 per vessel depending on the class of inspection nominally required — to intermediaries who then distributed payments to contracted surveyors and, the submission alleges, to at least three officials within the registry itself with authority to countersign and release certificates. The whistleblower claims to have retained contemporaneous records, including electronic communications and financial transfer documentation, supporting the allegations.

"If the documentation is as described, this is not a case of isolated misconduct," said Anastasia Theocharidou, a maritime law professor at the University of Piraeus, speaking by telephone on Friday. "This is an allegation of an organised criminal enterprise operating within a public regulatory body that has global consequences, because Greek-certified ships are in every major port in the world."

The European Maritime Safety Agency, the EU body responsible for monitoring member state compliance with maritime safety standards, confirmed on Friday that it had been formally notified of the Greek investigation and was assessing whether EMSA's own audit processes had been adequate to detect the alleged irregularities. A spokesperson said the agency would cooperate fully with Greek judicial authorities and would conduct its own review of Hellenic Register audit records going back to 2019. The spokesperson declined to characterise the agency's preliminary assessment of the situation, citing the ongoing investigation.

The timing is sensitive for the European Commission, which last year approved a €340 million package of EU cohesion and structural funds partly designated for modernisation of Greek maritime regulatory infrastructure, including digitisation of the Hellenic Register's certification database — a project that was, ironically, intended in part to reduce the scope for manual manipulation of certification records. A Commission spokesperson said on Friday it was "premature to draw conclusions" about the relationship between the funding programme and the alleged fraud, but confirmed that a review of disbursement conditions was being considered.

A senior official within the Greek Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Island Policy, speaking without authorisation, described the ministry's internal reaction as one of genuine shock, and said that Minister Christos Stylianides had convened an emergency meeting of senior staff on Thursday evening after being briefed on the whistleblower's submission. The official said the minister was "acutely aware" that Greece's reputation as a maritime nation — its fleet represents approximately 20 percent of global shipping capacity by deadweight tonnage — depended on the credibility of its regulatory institutions. "This is an existential reputational issue, not merely a legal one," the official said.

The practical safety implications have alarmed maritime insurers. The International Group of P&I Clubs, which provides liability insurance for approximately 90 percent of the world's ocean-going tonnage, said in a statement on Friday that it was "urgently seeking clarification" from the Hellenic Register regarding which vessels might be affected and had requested a full list of certificates issued by the contracted surveyors named in the investigation. Lloyd's of London market sources, speaking informally, said underwriters were already beginning to discuss whether vessels with Hellenic Register certificates issued since 2019 might require re-inspection before cover renewals.

Whether those ships remain genuinely seaworthy is a separate question from whether their paperwork is legitimate — and it is one that investigators have not yet answered. A number of vessels certified through the alleged scheme may have received inspections that were adequate in practice even if the administrative process was corrupt, while others may have fundamental structural or mechanical deficiencies that were never properly assessed. The distinction matters enormously both for safety and for legal liability, particularly in the event of an incident involving a vessel whose certificate is subsequently found to be fraudulent.

Nikos Mantzoufas, secretary-general of the Union of Greek Shipowners, insisted on Friday that the membership should not be presumed complicit. "The shipowner pays for an inspection and receives a certificate," he said. "If the system issuing that certificate was corrupted, the shipowner is also a victim of that corruption." However, prosecutors indicated that their investigation would examine whether any shipowners or technical managers made payments with knowledge that inspections would not in fact be conducted, a finding that would expose them to criminal liability as well.

Three of the eleven individuals whose assets have been frozen had not been located by Greek authorities as of Friday evening, according to a justice ministry official. Interpol notices were being prepared.
