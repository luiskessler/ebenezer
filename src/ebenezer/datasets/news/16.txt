# Colombia's Peace Process With ELN Guerrillas Collapses After Bombing Campaign Kills 34 Soldiers in Arauca

**BOGOTÁ, Feb. 21** — Colombia's government formally suspended peace negotiations with the National Liberation Army on Friday after a coordinated series of explosives attacks attributed to the guerrilla organisation killed 34 soldiers and wounded 61 others across five municipalities in the oil-rich eastern department of Arauca over a 72-hour period beginning Wednesday, representing the deadliest attack on Colombian security forces in a single incident sequence since the FARC disarmament process of 2016 and plunging President Gustavo Petro's signature "Total Peace" policy into what government allies and opponents alike described as terminal crisis.

The attacks, which targeted military convoy routes, a forward operating base, and two rural police posts using a combination of improvised explosive devices, cylinder bombs, and drone-delivered munitions, were claimed in a communiqué posted to social media on Thursday by the ELN's eastern war front, which cited what it described as "systematic violations of humanitarian agreements" by Colombian security forces in Arauca as justification. The government and military rejected the characterisation absolutely, with Defence Minister Iván Velásquez calling the attacks "a massacre against the state and against the Colombian people" that bore no relationship to any legitimate political grievance.

President Petro, who staked significant political capital on the Total Peace initiative when he took office in 2022 — the first left-wing president in Colombian history — and who had conducted four rounds of formal negotiations with the ELN in Havana, Caracas, and Mexico City over the preceding two years, announced the suspension at an emergency cabinet meeting in Bogotá on Friday morning. His statement was visibly painful in its delivery, acknowledging what he described as "the betrayal of a process that required extraordinary trust to begin."

"Colombia tried peace," Petro said. "The ELN chose war. The responsibility for what follows is theirs."

The ELN, founded in 1964 and inspired by Cuban revolutionary theory, is the last major active guerrilla organisation in Colombia following the FARC's 2016 disarmament under the peace accord negotiated by former president Juan Manuel Santos, which earned Santos the Nobel Peace Prize. Unlike the FARC, the ELN has never fully centralised its command structure, a feature that has historically complicated negotiations, as agreements reached with senior leadership have frequently been violated by field commanders who regard themselves as operationally autonomous.

That structural reality was cited by several analysts on Friday as central to understanding the attacks. A senior Colombian military intelligence official, speaking without authorisation, said the assessments of the armed forces suggested the eastern war front's actions had not been sanctioned by the ELN's central command, the National Directorate, and that the front's commander, known by the alias Pablito — real name Gustavo Aníbal Giraldo — had a documented history of undermining negotiation processes he perceived as threatening his operational independence. "This is not the ELN deciding to go back to war," the official said. "This is a faction of the ELN deciding it never agreed to peace. The distinction matters, but it may not be politically sustainable."

Whether that distinction could be made to matter politically was the central question in Bogotá on Friday. Petro's government has faced mounting criticism from conservative opposition figures, military commanders, and regional governors throughout the negotiation process over what critics characterised as excessive concessions to the ELN, including ceasefire arrangements that critics argued had allowed the organisation to consolidate territorial control in Arauca, Norte de Santander, and Chocó while nominal talks proceeded. Senator Paloma Valencia of the Centro Democrático party, among the most persistent critics of the Total Peace policy, said on Friday that the attacks had "confirmed every warning that was given and ignored."

Arauca, the department at the centre of the current violence, sits on the border with Venezuela and contains significant oil infrastructure operated by the state company Ecopetrol and its international partners. The department has been a zone of permanent conflict for decades, contested not only between the state and the ELN but between the ELN and FARC dissident factions that rejected the 2016 peace accord and have continued armed operations under various names. Inter-guerrilla violence in Arauca killed more than 200 civilians in 2021 alone, according to figures compiled by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.

Venezuela's role in the ELN's operations has been a persistent source of diplomatic friction. Multiple Colombian, American, and UN assessments have concluded that ELN units use Venezuelan territory for rest, resupply, and command functions, with the knowledge and at least tacit acceptance of the Maduro government in Caracas. Petro, who restored diplomatic relations with Venezuela after his predecessor Iván Duque severed them, had sought to use that relationship as a diplomatic lever to encourage Venezuelan pressure on the ELN toward a settlement. A Venezuelan foreign ministry statement on Friday expressed "condolences for the loss of life" and called for dialogue without addressing the question of ELN presence on Venezuelan soil.

The United States, which designates the ELN as a foreign terrorist organisation and which has maintained significant counter-narcotics and security assistance programmes in Colombia, expressed condolences through the State Department and said it stood ready to support Colombian security efforts. A State Department spokesperson stopped short of explicitly endorsing the suspension of talks, saying Washington supported "Colombia's sovereign decisions about how to pursue peace and security." The European Union, which had provided technical support to the negotiation process and stationed observers at several rounds of talks, said it was "deeply saddened" by the attacks and called on the ELN to recommit to dialogue.

Cuba and Norway, which served as guarantor nations for the negotiation process, both issued carefully worded statements on Friday urging restraint and expressing willingness to facilitate a return to talks when conditions allowed. Neither government addressed the question of whether the ELN's actions constituted a fundamental breach of the negotiating framework both countries had helped construct.

In Arauca itself, the mood among civilians was one of exhausted resignation familiar from decades of oscillating violence and failed political processes. Community leaders in the departmental capital Arauca city, reached by telephone on Friday, described heightened military presence on the streets and a palpable sense of anxiety about what the coming weeks would bring.

"We have seen this before," said one community leader, who declined to give her name out of security concerns. "The talks stop, the bombing starts, people die, and eventually someone sits down at a table again. We are the ones who live in the middle of it every time."

The Colombian military announced Friday evening that it had launched air and ground operations against ELN positions in Arauca in response to the attacks. Casualty figures from those operations were not immediately available.
