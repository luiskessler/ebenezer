# Bolivia's Lithium Nationalisation Unravels as Chinese Joint Venture Collapses and Economy Contracts

**LA PAZ, Feb. 21** — Bolivia's government acknowledged on Friday that its flagship lithium nationalisation programme, the centrepiece of successive administrations' promises to transform the country's vast salt flat deposits into the foundation of a sovereign industrial economy, had suffered what Economy Minister Marcelo Montenegro described as "a significant operational setback" after the Chinese state enterprise CATL — the world's largest battery manufacturer — formally terminated its joint venture agreement with the state lithium company YLB, citing what CATL representatives described in a letter reviewed by Bolivian congressional investigators as "irremedial delays in infrastructure delivery, persistent technical access restrictions, and a governance environment incompatible with the operational requirements of commercial-scale production."

The termination, confirmed by YLB's board in a statement released late Thursday and reported in full by Bolivian newspapers on Friday morning, effectively collapses the most substantial foreign investment commitment in Bolivian lithium development since the government of President Luis Arce formalised the state-led model in 2022, and leaves the country's direct lithium extraction pilot programme — whose technology CATL had agreed to deploy and whose commercial scale-up was projected to generate revenues that official forecasts had incorporated into medium-term fiscal planning — without a commercial partner, without the specialised extraction equipment whose installation is approximately 40 percent complete at the Salar de Uyuni site, and without a clear path to the production timeline that the government had publicly committed to in statements to the National Assembly and to international development finance institutions.

"This is a disaster for Bolivia's lithium programme," said Pablo Poveda Ávila, a researcher at the Centro de Estudios para el Desarrollo Laboral y Agrario in La PAZ and one of the country's most cited analysts of the lithium sector, speaking by telephone on Friday. "CATL does not walk away from a project of this strategic importance without having concluded that the fundamental conditions for its success do not exist. That conclusion, coming from the world's largest battery company, is a verdict on the programme that the government cannot easily dismiss."

The Bolivian lithium sector's difficulties are rooted in a combination of geological complexity, institutional dysfunction, and the particular political economy of resource nationalism in a country whose history of foreign exploitation of natural resources — silver in the colonial period, tin in the twentieth century, gas in the neoliberal era — has generated a constitutional and political framework so protective of state control that it has proven difficult to structure foreign partnerships on terms that both satisfy nationalist requirements and meet the operational and financial standards of potential commercial partners.

Bolivia's lithium deposits, concentrated primarily in the Salar de Uyuni in the Potosí department, are among the largest in the world by estimated resource volume, containing what the US Geological Survey assessed as approximately 21 million tonnes of lithium — roughly a fifth of global identified resources. However, the deposits present extraction challenges that distinguish them from the more commercially developed lithium brines of Chile and Argentina: higher magnesium-to-lithium ratios that complicate conventional evaporation-based extraction, altitude and remoteness that increase infrastructure costs, and the technical uncertainty associated with direct lithium extraction technology that has not yet been demonstrated at commercial scale anywhere in the world.

Those technical challenges were known when CATL signed its joint venture agreement with YLB in January 2023, and the Chinese company had committed to providing the proprietary direct extraction technology it had developed through its own research programme. The subsequent deterioration of the partnership appears to have been driven primarily by the governance and access restrictions that CATL's termination letter cited rather than by technical obstacles alone. Bolivian congressional investigators who have reviewed correspondence between the two parties described on Friday a pattern of YLB management requiring changes to agreed technical protocols for reasons that CATL engineers characterised as politically motivated rather than technically justified, access restrictions to the Uyuni site that delayed installation of extraction pilot equipment by an accumulated fourteen months, and disputes over intellectual property arrangements that the Chinese side said had been renegotiated unilaterally by YLB after the original agreement was signed.

A senior YLB official, speaking without authorisation, denied that access restrictions had been politically motivated and said the delays reflected "legitimate concerns about the protection of Bolivia's strategic interests in a sector of national importance." The official acknowledged that the relationship had become "increasingly difficult" in its final months but characterised CATL's decision to terminate as "a business decision reflecting changed market conditions" rather than a response to Bolivian governance failures.

The market conditions argument has some empirical foundation. Global lithium prices have fallen approximately 80 percent from their 2022 peak as electric vehicle demand growth has slowed below earlier projections and as Australian and South American production expansions have added supply faster than demand has grown. In that price environment, the economics of developing a technically challenging Bolivian deposit using unproven extraction technology have deteriorated significantly from the projections that underpinned the 2023 agreement.

The fiscal consequences for Bolivia are potentially serious. The government's medium-term fiscal framework, submitted to the National Assembly in October and reviewed by the IMF in its most recent Article IV consultation, incorporated projected lithium revenues beginning in 2027 that economists had privately described as optimistic even before the CATL termination. Those projections will now need to be revised substantially downward. Bolivia's fiscal position is already under strain: the country has experienced significant foreign exchange reserve depletion over the past three years as subsidies for fuel and other consumer goods — maintained at enormous fiscal cost as a political commitment of the Arce government and its MAS party predecessor — have continued in the face of declining gas export revenues as Bolivia's hydrocarbon reserves mature.

Foreign exchange reserves fell to approximately $1.8 billion in January, their lowest level in more than two decades, producing intermittent fuel and dollar shortages that have caused queues at petrol stations in La Paz, Santa Cruz, and other major cities and that have damaged the government's political credibility with urban middle-class voters whose support MAS has traditionally relied upon alongside its base in indigenous rural communities and the coca-growing Chapare region.

The political context of the CATL termination is further complicated by the continuing fracture within MAS between supporters of President Arce and those aligned with former president Evo Morales, who governed Bolivia from 2006 to 2019 and whose break with Arce has produced two competing MAS structures, legal disputes over the party's identity and resources, and a political paralysis that has impeded the legislative cooperation required for several economic reform measures that international creditors have identified as necessary for Bolivia's fiscal stabilisation.

Morales, speaking from his political base in the Chapare on Friday, described the CATL termination as "the inevitable consequence of Arce's incompetence and his government's failure to honour commitments made to the Bolivian people about the lithium programme." Arce's office did not respond to Morales's statement. The relationship between the two men has deteriorated to the point where both have filed criminal complaints against the other in Bolivian courts — a dual prosecution situation that legal scholars have described as without precedent in Bolivian democratic history and that has consumed significant judicial and political attention that might otherwise have been directed toward the economic challenges the country faces.

Brazil's development bank BNDES, which had been exploring a separate Bolivian lithium partnership focused on battery manufacturing rather than primary extraction, confirmed on Friday that it was "reassessing the partnership framework in light of recent developments" — language that Brazilian business journalists interpreted as a signal that the Brazilian commitment was also in doubt.

The one potential commercial alternative that Bolivian lithium officials have been cultivating is a European consortium whose participation has been discussed in general terms for two years but which has not progressed to a formal agreement. A representative of the consortium, speaking informally, said on Friday that CATL's departure had created an opening but that the governance concerns the Chinese company had raised would need to be addressed before any new partnership could be structured. "The issue is not Bolivia's lithium," the representative said. "The issue is whether Bolivia can structure a partnership that works commercially. CATL is not a naive counterpart. If they couldn't make it work, that tells you something that any potential successor has to take seriously."

In Potosí, whose communities sit above the salt flats that contain the lithium deposits and whose population has watched successive waves of promised transformation from resource wealth arrive and dissipate across centuries, the news of CATL's departure was received with the particular combination of anger and resignation that long experience of disappointed promise produces.

"They told us lithium would be different," said one community leader in the city of Potosí, reached by telephone on Friday. "They said this time it would be for us. It is the same story with different minerals."
