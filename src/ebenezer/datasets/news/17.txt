# Pakistan's IMF Programme at Risk as Punjab Flood Relief Spending Blows Out Fiscal Targets and Army Tensions Simmer

**ISLAMABAD, Feb. 21** — Pakistan's fragile economic stabilisation programme with the International Monetary Fund came under renewed pressure on Friday after the government disclosed that emergency flood relief and reconstruction expenditure in Punjab province, where catastrophic flooding in January inundated more than 2.8 million acres of agricultural land and displaced 4.1 million people, had exceeded budgeted contingency allocations by approximately 340 billion Pakistani rupees, pushing the federal fiscal deficit for the first seven months of the current financial year to a level that Treasury officials privately acknowledged was inconsistent with the quarterly targets agreed with the Fund when Pakistan's 37-month Extended Fund Facility was approved last September.

The disclosure, contained in a supplementary budget document tabled before the National Assembly on Thursday evening and reported in full by Pakistani financial newspapers on Friday morning, came at a particularly sensitive moment: an IMF Article IV consultation mission is scheduled to arrive in Islamabad on March 3rd for the programme's second review, and Pakistani officials had been projecting cautious confidence in recent weeks that the review would proceed without major difficulty. That confidence has now visibly dissipated, with Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb cancelling a scheduled media briefing on Friday without explanation — a decision that financial analysts in Karachi interpreted as a signal that the ministry was engaged in urgent internal damage assessment.

"The numbers as disclosed are not compatible with the programme targets," said Sakib Sherani, a former chief economic adviser to the Pakistani government and one of the country's most respected macroeconomists, reached by telephone in Islamabad on Friday. "The question is whether the IMF treats this as a technical deviation requiring a waiver, which is manageable, or as evidence of a broader fiscal control problem, which is a much more serious matter."

The IMF's resident representative in Islamabad issued a brief statement saying the Fund was "monitoring developments" and looked forward to "continued constructive engagement" with Pakistani authorities — language that analysts said was deliberately non-committal and could be read as either reassuring or cautionary depending on one's predisposition.

Pakistan has been in near-continuous engagement with the IMF for most of the past three decades, and the current programme — its 24th with the Fund — was secured after the country came within weeks of a sovereign default in mid-2023, an episode that devastated household savings, drove inflation to 38 percent, and produced fuel and power shortages that paralysed large sections of the economy for months. The stabilisation achieved since then has been real but brittle: inflation has fallen to approximately 8 percent, foreign exchange reserves have recovered to cover roughly two and a half months of imports, and the current account has moved into modest surplus. The structural vulnerabilities — a chronically low tax-to-GDP ratio, a bloated public sector energy circular debt, and an export base that has barely grown in real terms for a decade — remain substantially unaddressed.

The Punjab flooding arrived as a compounding shock against that fragile baseline. The January inundation, caused by an unusual combination of unseasonal rainfall and snowmelt from the Himalayan foothills following an exceptionally warm winter, affected primarily the agricultural heartland of central and southern Punjab, destroying standing wheat and sugarcane crops whose loss the Pakistan Agriculture Research Council estimated would reduce the province's agricultural output by between 12 and 18 percent for the current season. The damage to rural infrastructure — roads, irrigation channels, rural health facilities — was assessed by the National Disaster Management Authority at approximately 580 billion rupees, of which less than a third is covered by existing federal and provincial contingency budgets.

The Punjab provincial government of Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, daughter of three-time former prime minister Nawaz Sharif whose Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz leads the federal coalition, responded to the flooding with a high-profile relief operation that included direct cash transfers, free seed distribution, and a waiver of agricultural loan repayments for affected farmers — measures that were politically popular but that expanded the spending overshoot that now threatens the IMF programme.

A senior provincial finance official in Lahore, speaking without authorisation, defended the expenditure as unavoidable. "You cannot tell four million displaced people that the IMF programme requires us to stay within budget," the official said. "These are human beings, not line items." The official acknowledged, however, that coordination between Lahore and Islamabad over the fiscal implications of the relief spending had been inadequate in the programme's early weeks.

The IMF programme's difficulties are further entangled with a political and civil-military dynamic of exceptional complexity even by Pakistani standards. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's coalition government has maintained a working relationship with the army's General Headquarters under Chief of Army Staff General Asim Munir, but that relationship has been strained in recent months by disagreements over the pace of privatisation of state-owned enterprises — a key IMF structural benchmark — in which the military has significant institutional interests through the army's extensive commercial holdings managed by the Fauji Foundation and associated entities.

A person familiar with discussions between civilian economic officials and GHQ representatives, who spoke on condition of strict anonymity given the extreme sensitivity of civil-military relations in Pakistan, said the army had expressed "strong reservations" about the proposed privatisation of two state-owned enterprises in the energy sector in which military-affiliated pension funds held minority stakes. Those reservations had not been formally communicated through any official channel but had been conveyed in ways that civilian officials understood as carrying significant weight. "In Pakistan, you don't need a memo from GHQ to understand what GHQ wants," the person said.

The privatisation programme is among the structural benchmarks the IMF is expected to assess most closely during the March review. Pakistan Petroleum Limited and the power distribution company LESCO have both been listed for divestiture under the programme's timeline, with expressions of interest from potential buyers due by the end of the current quarter. Whether those processes will proceed on schedule given the political complexities is now openly questioned among Karachi's financial community.

Despite the mounting pressures, several Pakistani economists cautioned against assuming the worst. Muzzammil Aslam, a former state bank official now working in the private sector, noted that the IMF had shown considerable flexibility with Pakistan during the 2023 crisis and had approved waivers on multiple technical breaches during the previous standby arrangement. "The Fund understands that Pakistan is a systemically important country in a strategically sensitive region," he said. "That understanding has historically translated into a degree of programme flexibility that smaller or less geopolitically significant countries do not receive."

Whether that flexibility extends to the current situation will become clear when the March mission completes its assessment. Pakistani officials are understood to be preparing a fiscal adjustment package — likely involving a combination of additional revenue measures and expenditure rationalisation — to present to the Fund as evidence of corrective intent. The package's political viability, in a coalition government dependent on multiple parties and operating under the permanent shadow of military institutional interests, remains uncertain.

Markets reflected the anxiety. The Pakistani rupee fell 1.4 percent against the dollar on Friday to close at 279.80, its weakest level in four months, while yields on Pakistan's domestic treasury bills rose across all maturities in the weekly auction.
