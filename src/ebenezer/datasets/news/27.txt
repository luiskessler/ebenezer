# Kazakhstan Faces Rare Political Crisis as Energy Sector Strike Spreads and President Tokayev Dismisses Cabinet

**NUR-SULTAN, Feb. 21** — Kazakhstan's President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev dismissed his entire cabinet on Friday in a move that caught senior government officials and foreign investors off guard, as a strike by oil and gas workers that began eleven days ago at a major production facility in the Mangystau region on the eastern shore of the Caspian Sea spread to encompass workers at three additional extraction sites and a major pipeline pumping station, threatening to disrupt output from fields that collectively produce approximately 18 percent of Kazakhstan's total crude oil export volume and that underpin the revenue base of a state whose fiscal position has deteriorated markedly since global oil prices softened in the fourth quarter of last year.

The cabinet dismissal, announced in a brief presidential decree published on the Akorda website at 3:47 Friday afternoon local time without prior warning, named no specific failures on the part of the outgoing government of Prime Minister Alikhan Smailov, who had served in the role since January 2022 following his appointment in the aftermath of the January 2022 unrest — the most serious political crisis Kazakhstan had faced since independence — in which more than 230 people were killed during protests that began over fuel prices and rapidly escalated into a broader challenge to elite power that Tokayev suppressed with military force and Russian assistance under the CSTO mutual defence framework. Smailov will serve as caretaker prime minister until a successor is confirmed by the Mazhilis, Kazakhstan's lower house of parliament, which has been convened for an emergency session on Monday.

The timing of the dismissal, eleven days into a strike that the government had initially sought to characterise as a localised labour dispute manageable through existing industrial relations mechanisms, was interpreted by analysts and diplomats in the capital as an acknowledgement that the situation had evolved beyond what those mechanisms could contain, and that Tokayev had calculated a visible act of political disruption was preferable to the appearance of a government paralysed by events it could not control.

"This is Tokayev doing what he has done before — moving faster than the crisis rather than being overtaken by it," said Dosym Satpayev, a political analyst at the Kazakhstan Risk Assessment Group in Almaty, speaking by telephone on Friday. "The cabinet becomes the lightning rod. The president remains above the situation. Whether it works depends on what happens in Mangystau over the next week."

The strike, which began on February 10th at the Zhanaozen field complex operated by KazMunayGas, the state energy company, initially involved approximately 800 workers demanding wage increases of between 40 and 60 percent to compensate for inflation that has eroded real incomes significantly over the past two years, improved safety standards following a fatal accident at the facility in December that killed two workers, and what the strike committee described as the reinstatement of 34 employees dismissed in the past year for trade union activities. The demands were rejected by KazMunayGas management as "economically unrealistic" in an initial response on February 12th that strikers described as contemptuous and that appeared to harden rather than soften the dispute.

Zhanaozen carries particular historical weight in Kazakhstan's political consciousness. It was there, in December 2011, that security forces opened fire on striking oil workers, killing at least 14 people in what became the defining atrocity of the Nazarbayev era and a reference point for every subsequent discussion of labour rights and state violence in the country. The current government has been acutely sensitive to any parallel with 2011 and has conspicuously avoided the kind of forceful police response that characterised that episode, a restraint that some analysts credited to genuine political learning and others attributed primarily to the different information environment of 2026, in which videos of security force violence would circulate internationally within hours.

A senior KazMunayGas official, speaking without authorisation, said the company had received instructions from "the highest political level" to avoid coercive action against strikers and to pursue negotiated resolution, but acknowledged that three rounds of talks conducted since February 14th had produced no agreement, with the core wage demand remaining the principal obstacle. The official said the company was constrained by a government-wide public sector wage framework that limited what it could offer without setting precedents for other state enterprises.

The spread of the strike to additional sites — including the giant Tengiz field, where workers affiliated with a solidarity committee launched a go-slow action on Tuesday and a partial work stoppage on Thursday — has alarmed international investors in Kazakhstan's energy sector. Tengiz is operated by Tengizchevroil, a joint venture in which Chevron holds a 50 percent stake, ExxonMobil 25 percent, KazMunayGas 20 percent, and the Russian company Lukoil 5 percent. A spokesperson for Chevron said on Friday that the company was "monitoring the situation closely" and was "in dialogue with all relevant parties to ensure the continued safe operation of the facility," language that oil industry analysts said signalled concern while studiously avoiding characterisation of the disruption's severity.

ExxonMobil declined to comment. A person familiar with the Tengizchevroil joint venture's internal assessments, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said output at Tengiz had been reduced by approximately 12 percent from normal levels as a result of the go-slow and partial stoppage, a figure that, if sustained, would represent a significant but not immediately critical reduction in the approximately 700,000 barrels per day the field produces at full capacity.

The international dimension of Kazakhstan's energy sector adds a layer of geopolitical sensitivity to what might in other circumstances be a purely domestic labour dispute. Kazakhstan exports the majority of its crude oil through the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, a system that traverses Russian territory to terminals on the Black Sea and that Russia has on multiple occasions demonstrated its willingness to disrupt for political leverage — most recently in 2022, when technical problems at the Novorossiysk terminal that Russian officials described as weather-related coincided with Kazakhstan's reluctance to support Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. Any significant reduction in Kazakh production compounds existing pressure on an export system whose reliability has been a persistent concern for European importers seeking to reduce dependence on Russian energy.

The European Union's energy commissioner, reached for comment through a spokesperson on Friday, said Brussels was "following developments in Kazakhstan's energy sector" and was "in contact with Kazakh authorities through appropriate channels" — diplomatic language that suggested awareness without public alarm.

Tokayev's handling of the crisis will be closely watched by the political elite that surrounds him, by the family and business networks associated with former president Nursultan Nazarbayev whose influence within Kazakh institutions remained significant despite the post-January 2022 purges, and by the international financial community whose confidence in Kazakhstan as a stable investment destination has been an important element of the country's economic model. The World Bank's latest Kazakhstan economic update, published in December, described the country's growth prospects as "broadly positive but subject to downside risks from commodity price volatility and social pressures arising from inflation's impact on household incomes" — a formulation that now reads as prescient.

Whether the cabinet dismissal will be accompanied by substantive policy changes capable of addressing the underlying grievances driving the strike — wage stagnation, inflation, and the specific concerns of Mangystau's oil workers — or whether it will prove to be political theatre without economic substance, will become clearer when Tokayev presents a new government and its programme to the Mazhilis next week.

The strike committee in Zhanaozen issued a statement on Friday evening saying the cabinet dismissal was "a political manoeuvre that changes nothing for the workers of Mangystau" and that the strike would continue until their specific demands were addressed by whoever led the new government. They set a deadline of February 28th.
