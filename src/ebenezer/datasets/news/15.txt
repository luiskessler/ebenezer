# Ethiopia's Tigray Ceasefire Unravels as Armed Clashes Resume Along Disputed Administrative Boundary

**ADDIS ABABA, Feb. 21** — The fragile peace that has held across Ethiopia's northern Tigray region since the November 2022 Pretoria Agreement showed signs of irreversible breakdown on Friday after the Ethiopian federal government confirmed that armed engagements between units of the Ethiopian National Defence Force and fighters affiliated with the Tigray People's Liberation Front had occurred on at least four separate occasions in the past eleven days along the disputed boundary between Tigray and the neighbouring Amhara region, with each side accusing the other of initiating hostilities in what analysts described as a dangerous pattern of escalatory reciprocity.

The fighting, which has been heaviest around the town of Alamata in the southern Tigray zone and in the Raya corridor — an agriculturally and strategically significant area whose administrative status has been contested between Tigray and Amhara regional authorities for decades — represents the most serious violation of the Pretoria ceasefire since it was signed under African Union auspices in the South African capital nearly twenty-eight months ago, ending a two-year war that the United Nations estimated had killed between 300,000 and 500,000 people, the majority from famine and disease rather than direct combat, in what was widely described as one of the worst humanitarian catastrophes of the twenty-first century.

"What we are seeing is not an accident and it is not a localised incident," said William Davison, the International Crisis Group's senior analyst for Ethiopia, speaking by telephone from Nairobi on Friday. "The Raya corridor question was deliberately left unresolved at Pretoria because it was too difficult. What was deferred has not gone away. It has accumulated pressure."

The Ethiopian federal government's statement, issued by the Government Communications Service late Thursday and confirming the clashes while placing primary blame on what it called "TPLF-affiliated irregular forces," was notably restrained in its characterisation of the situation, stopping short of declaring a formal ceasefire violation and calling instead for "immediate de-escalation through existing joint monitoring mechanisms." The TPLF issued a sharply worded counter-statement accusing Amhara regional special forces, operating with the knowledge of federal military commanders, of conducting incursions into areas it described as undisputedly Tigrayan territory, and warning that its fighters had responded in self-defence and would continue to do so.

A senior official within the African Union's Peace and Security Department, speaking without authorisation because the AU is actively engaged in mediation efforts, said the organisation had dispatched an emergency monitoring team to the affected area on Wednesday and was pressing both parties to agree to a mutual pullback of forces to positions held before February 10th. The official described the AU's access to reliable ground-level information as "extremely limited" given the terrain and the communications restrictions both sides have imposed in areas of active engagement. "We are working with incomplete information and we are working fast," the official said.

The Pretoria Agreement's implementation has been troubled from the outset. Its core provisions — the disarmament and reintegration of TPLF fighters into federal security structures, the restoration of Tigray's regional government, and the normalisation of basic services including banking, telecommunications, and humanitarian access — have been implemented partially and unevenly, with each side accusing the other of bad faith on specific benchmarks. The TPLF has repeatedly complained that disarmament has proceeded further on the Tigrayan side than federal commitments to service restoration and political normalisation have been honoured. Federal authorities have countered that the TPLF has retained parallel command structures and weapons caches in violation of the agreement's security provisions.

The humanitarian situation in Tigray, while improved from the catastrophic conditions of the war years, remains deeply precarious. The World Food Programme reported last month that approximately 2.7 million people in the region remained food insecure, that agricultural recovery had been significantly impeded by the destruction of farm equipment and irrigation infrastructure during the war, and that the psychological and demographic damage from mass atrocities — documented by the UN Human Rights Council in a report last year that attributed serious violations to all parties but described ENDF and Eritrean forces as responsible for the most extensive crimes — had left communities with severely diminished capacity to rebuild.

The involvement of Eritrea, whose forces fought alongside the ENDF during the 2020-2022 war and committed what the UN described as extensive atrocities in Tigray, adds a further destabilising dimension. Eritrean forces nominally withdrew from Ethiopian territory as part of the Pretoria process, but multiple sources — including a confidential UN Panel of Experts report cited in the Security Council last year — assessed that Eritrean military elements remained present in parts of western Tigray and continued to conduct operations there. The Eritrean government has consistently denied those assessments.

President Isaias Afwerki of Eritrea, who has ruled the country without elections since independence in 1993 and whose relationship with Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has swung between close alliance and deep mutual suspicion, has made no public statement about the recent clashes. A senior Eritrean government official contacted by telephone in Asmara on Friday declined to comment.

International engagement with the Ethiopian peace process has diminished significantly since the initial diplomatic energy of the Pretoria period. The United States, which played an active role in pressuring both sides toward the 2022 agreement through the mediation of then-special envoy Mike Hammer, has reduced its diplomatic footprint on the Ethiopia file amid competing priorities. The European Union, which suspended budgetary support to Ethiopia at the height of the war over human rights concerns, has gradually normalised relations and restored some assistance but has not returned to the level of political engagement it maintained before 2020.

Muferiat Kamil, Ethiopia's minister for peace — a portfolio created specifically to manage post-conflict reconciliation — said in a statement on Friday that the government was committed to the Pretoria Agreement and that the recent incidents would be addressed through "established mechanisms for managing boundary disputes." She did not announce any specific measures. Opposition figures and Tigray civil society representatives described the statement as inadequate given the seriousness of the situation.

Among the civilian population of Tigray, the news of resumed fighting has produced what aid workers and journalists with contacts in the region describe as a wave of dread. Many residents experienced the previous war's onset as a sudden eruption that gave communities little time to flee or prepare. A humanitarian coordinator with a major international NGO operating in Tigray, who declined to be identified because of concerns about access restrictions, said that several of the organisation's local staff had begun making contingency plans for their families. "People are frightened," the coordinator said. "They know what this looked like before it became a war. And they say it looks like that again."

The African Union's monitoring team was expected to report its preliminary findings to the AU Commission by Sunday.
