# India's Supreme Court Strikes Down Electoral Bonds Scheme Enforcement as Corruption Probe Implicates Ruling Party Donors

**NEW DELHI, Feb. 21** — India's Supreme Court issued a contempt ruling on Friday against the State Bank of India and the Election Commission for what a five-judge constitutional bench described as "deliberate and systematic non-compliance" with its landmark February 2024 judgment striking down the electoral bonds scheme, after investigators working for a court-appointed special committee produced evidence that the bank had failed to disclose the full transactional history of bonds purchased and encashed between 2018 and 2024, with the undisclosed records — partially reconstructed by the committee from parallel data sources — implicating donors whose subsequent receipt of government contracts, regulatory approvals, and mining licences the court described as presenting "a prima facie case of quid pro quo corruption of a serious and systemic nature."

The ruling, delivered by Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna in a packed courtroom in New Delhi on Friday morning and running to 247 pages, ordered the Central Bureau of Investigation to open formal inquiries into 23 specific donor-benefit pairings identified in the special committee's report, directed the State Bank of India to produce all withheld records within seven days under penalty of daily fines and potential criminal contempt proceedings against its chairman, and called on Parliament to enact comprehensive political finance legislation within eighteen months to replace the voided scheme — a timeline that opposition parties said was inadequate and that the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party said was an overreach of judicial authority into legislative affairs.

The BJP's response was immediate and combative. Union Law Minister Arjun Ram Meghwal issued a statement within two hours of the ruling accusing the court of "crossing the constitutional boundary between judicial review and legislative direction" and suggesting the eighteen-month legislative deadline would be contested through appropriate legal channels. Party spokespersons argued in television appearances through the afternoon that the special committee's methodology for reconstructing undisclosed bond records was "forensically unreliable" and that the donor-benefit correlations identified in its report reflected coincidence and legitimate government decision-making rather than corrupt exchange. The party stopped short of directly criticising the Chief Justice by name, a restraint that political observers noted was itself a calibrated choice in an environment where judicial-executive relations have been under persistent strain.

The implications for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, which is in its third term following last year's general election in which the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance retained power with a reduced majority, are potentially severe. Among the 23 donor-benefit pairings ordered for CBI investigation, at least seven involve companies whose principals are understood to have close personal relationships with senior BJP figures, and three involve infrastructure conglomerates that received environmental clearances for major projects in the months immediately following substantial bond purchases — a sequencing that the special committee's report described as "temporally and circumstantially significant."

The opposition Indian National Congress and its INDIA alliance partners held a joint press conference on Friday afternoon at which Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge described the ruling as "the most important accountability moment in Indian democratic history since the Emergency" and called on Modi to address the nation personally to explain his government's relationship with the implicated donors. He demanded the resignation of the finance minister and the law minister pending the CBI investigations. The Aam Aadmi Party's Arvind Kejriwal, himself a beneficiary of opposition solidarity during his own legal entanglements in recent years, described the ruling as "proof that when institutions hold firm, democracy survives."

The electoral bonds scheme, introduced through a Finance Act amendment in 2018 without parliamentary debate as a standalone bill, allowed individuals and corporations to purchase bearer bonds from the State Bank of India in denominations up to one crore rupees and donate them anonymously to political parties, which could encash them through designated accounts. The scheme's architects argued it would replace cash donations with traceable instruments while protecting donor identity from potential political retaliation. Critics, including all major opposition parties and a broad range of electoral reform organisations, argued from the outset that the anonymity provision made it an institutionalised mechanism for opaque corporate funding of the ruling party.

The Supreme Court's original February 2024 judgment — a unanimous decision by a five-judge bench that described the scheme as unconstitutional on grounds of violation of the right to information — had ordered full disclosure of all bond transactions. The State Bank of India's subsequent partial disclosure, widely reported at the time, revealed that the BJP had received approximately 57 percent of all bonds encashed, with the Congress a distant second. The special committee's work over the following twelve months had sought to reconstruct the complete picture from the bank's internal records and had, its report concluded, identified a substantial body of transactions that the bank had not included in its court-ordered disclosure.

A senior official within the special committee's secretariat, speaking on condition of anonymity because the committee's full report remains partially sealed, said the undisclosed transactions were not randomly distributed across parties but were "heavily concentrated in a pattern that is not consistent with administrative oversight." The official declined to specify the political distribution of the withheld records pending the court's formal unsealing process, which Chief Justice Khanna ordered completed within fourteen days.

The CBI, which operates under the administrative supervision of the home ministry and whose institutional independence has been questioned by opposition parties and international observers in recent years, faces a delicate challenge in pursuing investigations that may implicate donors with political connections to the government that nominally oversees it. The Supreme Court addressed this tension directly in Friday's ruling, establishing a special monitoring mechanism under a retired Supreme Court judge to oversee the CBI inquiries and report directly to the court at sixty-day intervals — a structural safeguard that legal experts described as unusually direct judicial supervision of an executive investigative agency.

Prashant Bhushan, the public interest litigation lawyer whose petition had initiated the original electoral bonds challenge before the court, said on Friday that the contempt ruling represented "the court doing what courts are supposed to do when the executive treats a constitutional judgment as a suggestion." He cautioned, however, that the ultimate test would be whether the CBI investigations produced prosecutions and whether those prosecutions were conducted without interference. "India has seen many investigations opened and quietly closed," he said. "The court has created the best possible structural conditions for accountability. Whether those conditions produce actual accountability depends on humans, and humans in this system are subject to pressures the court cannot fully control."

International reaction was measured. Transparency International welcomed the ruling as "an important demonstration that judicial independence can function as an effective check on executive power even in systems under democratic stress." The United States Embassy in New Delhi issued no immediate statement. The European Union's delegation said it "noted" the ruling and expressed support for "transparent and accountable democratic processes."

Markets showed moderate concern. The BSE Sensex fell 1.3 percent on Friday, with particular weakness in shares of infrastructure and mining conglomerates whose names had circulated in media reporting on the special committee's findings. Legal analysts said the CBI would face a minimum of six to twelve months of preliminary investigation before any charges could be filed, and that a full trial, given the complexity of financial evidence involved, remained years away even under optimistic assumptions about institutional functioning.

The State Bank of India's chairman had not responded publicly to the contempt finding by Friday evening. His lawyers were understood to be preparing an urgent application for clarification of the court's compliance timeline.
