# Mexico City Water Crisis Deepens as Aquifer Depletion Accelerates and Federal Relief Talks Collapse

**MEXICO CITY, Feb. 21** — Mexico City's water authority announced on Friday that mandatory rationing schedules affecting approximately 3.4 million residents in the capital's eastern and northeastern boroughs would be extended indefinitely beyond their originally scheduled March 15 expiration, as measurements from the Cutzamala system — the network of reservoirs and aqueducts that supplies roughly 25 percent of the metropolitan area's treated water — showed storage levels at 21.3 percent of capacity, the lowest recorded figure for this point in the calendar year since systematic monitoring began in 1982.

The announcement came one day after talks between the government of Mexico City and the federal water authority, CONAGUA, broke down without agreement over a proposed emergency infrastructure package that would have redirected treated water allocations from three neighbouring states and accelerated the construction of two new deep extraction wells in the Valley of Mexico aquifer system — itself the subject of intense scientific concern, as the aquifer has been identified by geologists as critically over-exploited, with extraction rates running at an estimated 1.5 times the natural recharge rate for more than three decades.

The failure of those talks, attributed by both sides to disagreements over cost-sharing arrangements and jurisdictional authority over inter-state water transfers, has left the capital's 22 million inhabitants facing what hydrologists describe as the most precarious water supply situation in the city's modern history — a crisis shaped equally by inadequate infrastructure investment, uncontrolled urban expansion, and the accelerating effects of climate variability on the highland rainfall patterns that feed the Cutzamala catchment.

"We have known this was coming for twenty years," said José Luis Luege Tamargo, a former CONAGUA director general and one of Mexico's most prominent water policy voices, in an interview on Friday. "Every administration has treated this as a problem to be managed in the short term rather than solved in the structural sense. We are now living with the consequences of that choice."

The rationing measures currently in effect divide the city's 16 boroughs into rotating zones that receive piped water supply for between 8 and 16 hours every three to four days, depending on location. Residents in the most severely affected zones — concentrated in Iztapalapa, Gustavo A. Madero, and Venustiano Carranza — have reported receiving water for as few as six hours in a given week, forcing widespread reliance on water tanker trucks, known locally as pipas, whose costs have risen sharply and whose supply is frequently insufficient to meet demand.

A senior official within Mexico City's Sistema de Aguas, the capital water utility, who spoke without authorisation, acknowledged that the pipa distribution network had been unable to keep pace with demand in the hardest-hit areas for the past six weeks. "We are triaging," the official said. "Hospitals and schools have priority. After that, we are doing what we can."

The human consequences have fallen disproportionately on lower-income households, which have less storage capacity and fewer financial resources to purchase trucked water at market prices. Community organisations in Iztapalapa, a borough of nearly 2 million people that has experienced chronic water access problems for decades, reported on Thursday that standpipe queues were regularly exceeding three hours and that several colonias had gone without any piped supply for more than two weeks.

Mexico City Mayor Clara Brugada, who took office in October, has faced growing public anger over the crisis and moved this week to shift blame toward the federal government, accusing CONAGUA of bad faith in the collapsed negotiations and calling on President Claudia Sheinbaum — herself a former Mexico City mayor with a doctorate in energy engineering and a long record of public statements acknowledging the capital's water vulnerability — to intervene personally to break the impasse. Sheinbaum's office said on Friday that the president was "personally engaged" with the situation and had requested a full technical briefing from CONAGUA for next week, but stopped short of announcing specific measures.

The intergovernmental friction has a structural dimension that transcends the personalities involved. Mexico City's water supply depends on systems that cross multiple state boundaries and are governed by a complex and frequently contested set of federal concessions, state agreements, and municipal arrangements whose legal relationships have never been fully rationalised. The State of Mexico, whose territory surrounds much of the capital and through which several key aqueducts run, has its own growing water demands and has in recent years shown increasing resistance to what its officials characterise as disproportionate federal prioritisation of Mexico City's supply needs.

The deeper geological problem compounds every political difficulty. The Valley of Mexico aquifer, on which the city has depended for centuries and which still provides approximately 60 percent of its water supply, is being depleted at a rate that has caused measurable and accelerating land subsidence across much of the urban area — in some zones exceeding 50 centimetres of sinking per year, according to measurements published last year by researchers at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. That subsidence has in turn damaged the very pipe infrastructure through which water is distributed, increasing leakage rates that the Sistema de Aguas estimates at between 35 and 40 percent of total system input.

"You have a city that is simultaneously running out of water and losing enormous quantities of the water it does have through broken pipes," said Denise Soares, a water security researcher at the Mexican Institute of Water Technology. "And the subsidence that breaks the pipes is caused in significant part by the over-extraction that depletes the aquifer. It is a self-reinforcing cycle, and the engineering interventions required to interrupt it are of a scale and cost that no single administration has been willing to confront."

Though the federal government has allocated 4.2 billion pesos in emergency water infrastructure funding for the capital region in the current fiscal year, engineers and municipal officials privately describe the figure as covering less than a fifth of the investment required to stabilise the situation over a five-year horizon, let alone address the structural deficit.

International precedents offer limited comfort. Several major cities — Cape Town, Chennai, São Paulo — have faced acute supply crises in recent years and managed to avert complete system failure through demand restriction and emergency supply measures. In each case, however, the acute crisis was eventually resolved by rainfall returning to normal or above-normal levels. Mexico City's crisis has a permanent geological dimension that rainfall alone cannot address.

A further round of federal-municipal talks has been scheduled for Tuesday.
