# Honduras Faces Constitutional Crisis as Supreme Court Blocks President Castro's Referendum on New Charter

**TEGUCIGALPA, Feb. 21** — Honduras descended into its deepest constitutional crisis in fifteen years on Friday after the Supreme Court of Justice issued an emergency injunction blocking President Xiomara Castro's government from proceeding with a national referendum on convening a constituent assembly to draft a new constitution, a vote that had been scheduled for April 27th and that Castro had framed as the defining democratic act of her presidency, only for the court to rule by a vote of eleven to four that the referendum mechanism employed violated three separate articles of the existing constitution and that the process had been initiated without the congressional authorisation that the constitution expressly requires for fundamental changes to the country's legal architecture.

Castro, who took office in January 2022 as Honduras's first woman president and whose Libre party won power after twelve years of National Party government marked by what independent observers characterised as systematic corruption, democratic erosion, and the 2009 coup that removed her husband Manuel Zelaya from the presidency — a removal itself triggered in part by Zelaya's own attempts to convene a constituent assembly referendum in circumstances that the Supreme Court of that era also ruled unconstitutional — appeared before cameras in Tegucigalpa within two hours of the ruling and delivered a combative address in which she described the court's decision as "a judicial coup executed by the same oligarchic networks that have blocked Honduran democracy for generations."

She announced that her government was evaluating "all constitutional and democratic options" available to it and called on supporters to mobilise in the capital and in departmental capitals across the country beginning Saturday. The announcement drew immediate comparisons to the political crisis of 2009, which Castro and her party have described as a template for elite resistance to progressive reform that they expected to face and had planned to overcome through popular mobilisation rather than institutional accommodation.

The Supreme Court's ruling, written by Chief Justice Rebeca Rámirez and running to 89 pages, found that Honduras's existing constitution — drafted in 1982 under military oversight and amended numerous times but never comprehensively replaced — does not contain a provision for its own replacement through popular referendum, and that the National Congress, not the executive branch, holds the authority to initiate any constituent process. The ruling cited the precedents of the 2009 constitutional crisis explicitly, finding that the legal arguments made by Castro's government were "substantially identical" to those made by Zelaya fifteen years earlier and "rejected with equal clarity" by the courts of that period.

"The constitution is not a garment to be discarded when it becomes inconvenient for those in power," Rámirez wrote in the majority opinion. "It is the framework within which democratic transformation, including transformation of the constitution itself, must occur."

The dissenting justices argued that the ruling applied an excessively rigid textualism that ignored the democratic will expressed in Castro's 2021 electoral mandate and that constituent power — the power of a sovereign people to determine its own fundamental law — could not be subordinated to the provisions of a document whose origins in military governance gave it questionable democratic legitimacy. "A constitution that cannot be changed by the people it governs is not a democratic constitution," wrote Justice Karla Romero in the principal dissent. "It is a cage."

The constitutional dispute has been building since Castro's election, when she made the constituent assembly one of her central campaign commitments. The existing 1982 constitution, drafted in the context of Cold War anti-communist politics under American influence and designed in part to insulate certain structural features of the Honduran state from democratic revision, contains a series of so-called pétreos — literally "stone" — articles declaring certain provisions, including those establishing the three-branch government structure and the prohibition on presidential re-election, permanently unamendable. Critics of the existing constitution argue it enshrines structural inequality and limits the state's capacity to address poverty, violence, and institutional corruption. Defenders argue it provides stability and protection against executive overreach.

The National Congress, where Castro's Libre party does not hold a majority and has governed in uneasy coalition with centrist parties whose support for constitutional reform has been conditional and inconsistent, had declined to authorise a constituent assembly process through legislative channels, citing the same constitutional concerns now articulated by the Supreme Court. Castro's decision to pursue the referendum through an executive decree and a national electoral tribunal ruling rather than through congressional authorisation was described by government legal advisers as a legitimate exercise of popular sovereignty; by opposition parties and the court as a circumvention of constitutional safeguards.

The United States, whose historically intimate and often damaging relationship with Honduran politics has evolved toward a posture of encouraging democratic stability and anti-corruption reform in the context of migration management priorities, issued a statement through the State Department on Friday urging "all parties to respect constitutional processes and resolve political differences through dialogue and democratic institutions." The statement did not characterise the court's ruling as correct or incorrect. A senior State Department official, speaking privately, expressed concern that the political confrontation could destabilise a country whose governance challenges already drive significant northward migration and whose cooperation on border management the administration values.

The Organisation of American States issued a statement calling for calm and dialogue and despatching its secretary-general's special representative to Tegucigalpa for consultations with all parties beginning Monday. The European Union, which has funded democratic governance programmes in Honduras and maintains active diplomatic engagement with the Castro government, expressed concern about the constitutional impasse and urged a negotiated resolution.

Domestically, the political polarisation that the referendum debate has deepened was immediately visible on Friday's streets. In Tegucigalpa, supporters of the constituent assembly began gathering outside the presidential palace by mid-afternoon, waving Libre party flags and chanting slogans in support of Castro. In the wealthy residential suburbs of the capital, where opposition to the constitutional reform has been most intense among business and professional elites, private WhatsApp groups circulated messages celebrating the court's ruling as a defence of constitutional order.

Business organisations, which have consistently opposed the constituent assembly on grounds that constitutional uncertainty would damage investment, welcomed the ruling. The Honduran Council of Private Enterprise described it as "a victory for the rule of law and for Honduras's democratic institutions." The Central General de Trabajadores, the country's largest trade union federation and a Libre party ally, described it as "an instrument of class power wielded by those who have always used the judiciary to protect their privileges."

Juan Orlando Hernández, Castro's predecessor whose twelve-year grip on Honduran politics ended with his 2022 extradition to the United States on drug trafficking and arms charges — he was convicted in New York in 2024 and is awaiting sentencing — cast a long shadow over Friday's events from his prison cell, a reminder of the depth of the institutional corruption that Castro's reform agenda was designed to address and that the constitutional dispute has obscured.

Whether Castro will comply with the court's injunction, attempt to circumvent it, or seek a negotiated political settlement that preserves some elements of her reform agenda through alternative legal mechanisms was the question that Honduran political observers and international diplomats were attempting to answer on Friday evening without confidence.

A senior government official, speaking without authorisation, said the administration's internal debate was "genuine and unresolved" and that decisions would be made over the weekend following consultations with allied social movements and legal advisers. "The president did not come this far to accept a judicial veto of the democratic mandate she was given," the official said. "But she also understands that the next steps carry consequences that require careful thought."

No public decision had been announced by the time the Presidential Palace closed for the evening.
