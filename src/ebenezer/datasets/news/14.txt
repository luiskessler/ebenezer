# Flooding Across Eastern Australia Kills 19 and Triggers Insurance Industry Warning of Systemic Underinsurance Crisis

**SYDNEY, Feb. 21** — Floodwaters that inundated more than 340 communities across Queensland and northern New South Wales over the past eight days, killing at least 19 people and displacing an estimated 78,000 residents from their homes, began receding in some areas on Friday while continuing to rise in others, as emergency services conducted what authorities described as the largest peacetime evacuation operation in Queensland's history and the insurance industry warned that a systemic underinsurance crisis across flood-prone regional Australia meant that tens of thousands of affected households faced financial ruin regardless of the eventual physical damage bill.

The floods, triggered by an atmospheric river event that brought rainfall totals exceeding 600 millimetres across parts of the Darling Downs and the Lockyer Valley in under seventy-two hours beginning last Saturday — nearly double the previous record for that period in those catchments according to the Bureau of Meteorology — caused dam operators at Wivenhoe Dam west of Brisbane to conduct controlled releases that inundated downstream communities, prompting accusations from local mayors that residents had received inadequate warning before floodwaters arrived. The Water Grid Manager, the Queensland government body responsible for the dam network, rejected those accusations on Friday, saying releases had followed established flood mitigation protocols and that all downstream councils had been notified through official channels.

"The protocols were followed," said Water Grid Manager chief executive Mark Sheraton at a briefing in Brisbane on Friday. "Whether those protocols are adequate given what climate change is doing to rainfall intensity in southeast Queensland is a legitimate question that deserves a serious answer."

At least seven of the 19 deaths involved individuals who entered floodwater in vehicles, a pattern that prompted Queensland Police Commissioner Katarina Carroll to issue an unusually direct public statement on Friday urging residents to treat road closure signs as absolute prohibitions. "We are not in a position to be subtle about this anymore," Carroll said. "If the road is closed, the water will kill you. That is not a possibility. It is a near-certainty." Search operations for two people reported missing in the Condamine River system continued on Friday, with authorities expressing diminishing hope of finding them alive.

The scale of property destruction is not yet fully quantifiable. Aerial surveys conducted by the Queensland Reconstruction Authority through Friday covered approximately 60 percent of the affected area and had identified more than 11,000 structures with visible water damage, of which an estimated 2,800 appeared to have sustained damage significant enough to require demolition or major structural repair. Those figures are expected to rise substantially as surveys extend to areas still inaccessible by road.

The Insurance Council of Australia estimated on Friday that insured losses from the event would likely fall between A$2.1 billion and A$3.4 billion, making it one of the five most costly flood events in Australian history. However, the Council's chief executive Andrew Hall warned that insured losses represented only a fraction of total economic damage, because a significant proportion of affected properties either carried no flood insurance or carried policies with flood exclusions or sub-limits that would leave policyholders substantially exposed.

"We have communities in this country where the majority of households in a flood zone are either uninsured or materially underinsured," Hall said at a press conference in Sydney on Friday. "That is not primarily a failure of individual decision-making. It is a failure of a system that has allowed premium costs to rise to levels where insurance has effectively ceased to be accessible for the households most at risk."

The affordability crisis in Australian flood insurance has been documented in successive government reviews over the past decade and has accelerated sharply following a series of major flood events in 2011, 2019, and 2022 that drove reinsurance costs to historic highs and prompted several major insurers to restrict or entirely withdraw flood coverage from the highest-risk postcodes. In some communities in the Lockyer Valley and on the Darling Downs, annual flood insurance premiums for standard residential properties have reached A$15,000 to A$25,000 — sums that place coverage beyond the financial reach of most residents, particularly in regional areas where household incomes are below the national median.

A senior official within the federal Treasury's financial systems division, speaking without authorisation, said the government was aware that the current market structure had produced outcomes that were "neither socially equitable nor economically rational" but acknowledged that no comprehensive policy solution had yet been developed. "The difficulty is that every mechanism that makes insurance more affordable in high-risk areas — subsidies, pooling, reinsurance backstops — involves either a transfer of risk to the public balance sheet or a cross-subsidy from lower-risk policyholders," the official said. "Both of those are politically contested."

The federal government announced on Friday an initial disaster recovery payment of A$1,000 per eligible adult and A$400 per child for residents of declared disaster areas across both affected states, a measure that Prime Minister Anthony Albanese described as "immediate relief" while acknowledging it represented only a partial response to the scale of loss many families faced. He announced that a Rapid Damage Assessment team would report to the National Emergency Management Agency within ten days and pledged that reconstruction funding would follow the assessment.

Queensland Premier David Crisafulli, whose state government carries primary responsibility for the emergency response, has navigated the crisis with visible strain, conducting daily briefings that have oscillated between defending the adequacy of the official response and acknowledging its limits. On Friday he confirmed that the state government would fund temporary accommodation for displaced residents for a period of up to six months and would establish a reconstruction advisory body modelled on the agency created after the 2011 Queensland floods to coordinate rebuilding across affected communities.

Though the immediate emergency response has drawn broadly positive assessments from affected communities, the longer-term questions it raises are considerably more fraught. Several of the communities hardest hit by this week's floods have flooded repeatedly — in some cases three or four times in the past fifteen years — raising questions about the viability of permanent settlement in their current locations that politicians have historically been reluctant to confront directly.

Sophie Lewis, a climate scientist at the Australian National University, said on Friday that the rainfall intensity recorded during the event was consistent with what climate models had projected for southeast Queensland under current emissions trajectories and that similar events should be expected to occur with greater frequency and severity in coming decades. "The question of whether we keep rebuilding in place is one that communities and governments have every right to find emotionally and politically difficult," she said. "But it is also a question that the physical environment is eventually going to answer for us, whether we make a considered decision or not."

Floodwaters in the Condamine system were not expected to peak until Sunday.
