# South Africa's Power Utility Faces Criminal Probe as Evidence of Systematic Looting Emerges During Restructuring Audit

**JOHANNESBURG, Feb. 21** — South Africa's National Prosecuting Authority confirmed on Friday that it had opened a formal criminal investigation into Eskom, the state-owned electricity utility whose near-collapse over the past decade plunged Africa's most industrialised economy into years of rolling blackouts, after forensic auditors appointed by the utility's board during an ongoing restructuring process uncovered evidence of what prosecutors described as "systematic and coordinated looting" of procurement budgets totalling an estimated 78 billion rand across a nine-year period, involving networks of shell companies, fraudulent maintenance contracts, and the deliberate sabotage of generating units to justify emergency procurement that bypassed normal competitive tendering.

The investigation, which the NPA said would be conducted jointly with the Hawks — South Africa's Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation — and the Special Investigating Unit, targets both former and current Eskom officials as well as private sector contractors and intermediaries. Arrest warrants for seventeen individuals have been prepared and are being executed on a rolling basis, the NPA's spokesperson Mthunzi Mhaga confirmed, declining to identify those targeted by name pending formal charging. Three individuals had been taken into custody by Friday afternoon, according to a person with knowledge of the operation.

The scale of the alleged fraud, if confirmed by prosecution, would represent one of the largest single instances of state capture-related corruption uncovered since the Zondo Commission — the judicial inquiry into state capture under former president Jacob Zuma — completed its work in 2022, and would provide a detailed forensic anatomy of how the dysfunction that brought South Africa's electricity grid to its knees was not merely the result of mismanagement but of deliberate criminal predation.

"What the forensic audit has uncovered is not negligence," said Eskom board chairperson Mteto Nyati at a press conference in Johannesburg on Friday. "It is organised crime conducted from within a state institution by people who understood precisely what they were doing and who appears to have understood that the consequences of what they were doing would fall on every South African, not on themselves."

Nyati said the board had referred the audit findings to the NPA in January after the forensic team's preliminary report reached conclusions that exceeded what the board had authority to address through internal disciplinary mechanisms. The full forensic report runs to more than 800 pages and has been provided to prosecutors in its entirety, he said. He declined to identify the forensic firm that conducted the audit, citing ongoing legal proceedings, but confirmed it was an internationally accredited firm with no prior Eskom engagements.

The audit's specific findings, portions of which were described to journalists by two people who had reviewed the document, detail several distinct fraud categories. The largest involves emergency maintenance contracts awarded to a network of companies that investigators allege share beneficial ownership through a series of layered holding structures, several of them registered in Mauritius and the United Arab Emirates, that connect ultimately to a small number of individuals previously employed in Eskom's generation division. Those companies billed Eskom for maintenance work at generating units — primarily coal-fired power stations in Mpumalanga province — that was either never performed or performed to a standard so deficient as to be functionally equivalent to non-performance.

A second category involves the deliberate introduction of contaminants into coal supplies at two major power stations, acts that caused boiler damage requiring emergency repair contracts — themselves then awarded to connected vendors at prices that forensic accountants assessed as between three and seven times market rates. This finding, described by an electricity sector analyst who reviewed preliminary details on condition of anonymity as "the most disturbing element of the entire audit," suggests that the fraud extended beyond passive extraction of procurement funds to active sabotage of generating infrastructure in order to create conditions that justified further extraction.

The allegation of deliberate sabotage has particular resonance given South Africa's experience of load shedding — the rolling blackouts that at their peak in 2023 reached Stage 6, cutting power for up to twelve hours daily and causing estimated economic damage of more than 900 billion rand over a three-year period. Eskom and the government consistently attributed the generating crisis primarily to ageing infrastructure and deferred maintenance. The audit findings, if substantiated in court, would suggest that while those factors were real, the depth of the crisis was materially worsened by criminal action.

Public Enterprises Minister Kgosientsho Ramokgopa, who oversees Eskom in cabinet, said on Friday that the findings were "shocking but not entirely surprising given what the country has lived through" and expressed confidence that the prosecutorial process would run its course without political interference. He was careful to frame the investigation as evidence of the current administration's commitment to accountability, a characterisation that opposition figures contested. Democratic Alliance spokesperson on public enterprises Kevin Mileham said the government bore responsibility for having allowed the conditions that made the looting possible to persist for years after their existence was widely documented. "This prosecution is welcome," he said. "But accountability that arrives a decade late is not the same thing as governance."

The investigation arrives at a moment when South Africa's electricity situation has improved materially from its nadir. Load shedding has been largely absent since mid-2024, a development the government attributes to the success of its energy action plan, which included expedited procurement from independent power producers, the repair of a significant number of previously unplanned generating unit outages, and the licensing of a large volume of private generation capacity by commercial and industrial users. Eskom's total generating availability has risen from below 55 percent at its worst point to approximately 68 percent currently, though engineers note the improvement rests on a still-fragile base of ageing coal plant that requires sustained maintenance investment.

The restructuring process within which the forensic audit was conducted is itself a central element of Eskom's recovery strategy. The utility is being separated into three distinct entities covering generation, transmission, and distribution, a process supported by a 254 billion rand government debt relief package approved in 2023 that was conditioned on governance reforms intended to prevent recurrence of the conditions that enabled the alleged fraud. The World Bank, which has provided analytical support to the restructuring, issued a statement on Friday welcoming the NPA investigation as "an important step toward establishing the accountability framework that sustainable energy sector reform requires."

The criminal proceedings are expected to be protracted. South Africa's history of major state capture prosecutions has been marked by lengthy legal battles, with several high-profile cases initiated by the NPA following the Zondo Commission still awaiting trial years after charges were laid. Jacob Zuma himself has not stood trial on the corruption charges that have followed him for two decades. Legal analysts cautioned that the complexity of the Eskom case — involving multiple jurisdictions, sophisticated corporate structures, and an evidence base of exceptional volume — would present significant prosecutorial challenges even given political will to see it through.

Despite those cautions, Friday's announcement produced an unmistakable current of public satisfaction in a country whose population had endured years of darkness and economic hardship while official explanations shifted and accountability remained elusive. On social media platforms, the reaction was immediate and pointed.

"Twelve hours of load shedding every day," one widely shared post read. "And now we know some of it was on purpose."
