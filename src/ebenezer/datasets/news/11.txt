# Taiwan Semiconductor Firms Brace for Export Control Expansion as Washington Signals New Restrictions on Advanced Packaging Technology

**TAIPEI, Feb. 21** — Taiwan's leading semiconductor manufacturers and their government scrambled to assess the potential impact of imminent new American export controls on Friday after senior US Commerce Department officials signalled to industry representatives in private meetings this week that a forthcoming rule, expected to be published within thirty days, would extend restrictions beyond chip design and fabrication to encompass advanced packaging technologies — the processes by which individual chips are integrated into high-performance computing modules — in a move that industry executives warned could disrupt supply chains worth hundreds of billions of dollars and complicate Taiwan's delicate position between its largest security patron and its largest trading partner.

The anticipated rule, which has not yet been formally published and whose precise technical scope remains subject to revision, is understood to target chip-on-wafer-on-substrate and other advanced three-dimensional packaging techniques that American officials believe have allowed Chinese technology companies to partially circumvent existing restrictions on advanced logic chips by acquiring separately legal components and integrating them into configurations with capabilities approaching those of restricted devices. A person familiar with the Commerce Department's deliberations, speaking on condition of anonymity because the rulemaking process is ongoing, said the new controls would likely require licences for the export of certain packaging equipment and for the provision of packaging services to customers in a defined list of countries of concern, with China heading that list.

The prospect has alarmed Taiwan's outsourced semiconductor assembly and test sector, known in the industry as OSAT, whose leading firms — including ASE Technology Holding, the world's largest packaging and testing company, and Powertech Technology — derive significant revenue from Chinese customers and from packaging operations conducted in facilities on the Chinese mainland. ASE declined to comment specifically on the anticipated rule but said in a statement that it was "monitoring regulatory developments closely and maintaining ongoing dialogue with relevant authorities in both Taiwan and the United States." Powertech did not respond to a request for comment.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, whose advanced packaging operations — marketed under the CoWoS brand — have become a critical bottleneck in global artificial intelligence hardware supply chains due to their role in assembling the high-bandwidth memory stacks used in Nvidia's data centre processors, is understood to face a more complex set of implications. TSMC's CoWoS capacity is overwhelmingly oriented toward American and other non-Chinese customers, which may insulate it from the most direct impacts. However, a senior Taiwanese government official, speaking without authorisation to discuss ongoing regulatory consultations, said Taipei was seeking clarification from Washington on whether the rule's equipment provisions could affect TSMC's ability to import certain US-origin packaging tools for its facilities currently under construction in Arizona and Japan.

"The concern is not only about China," the official said. "The concern is about whether rules drafted with China in mind end up constraining Taiwanese companies' ability to operate everywhere else as well."

The Taiwanese government has found itself in the by now familiar and uncomfortable position of needing to respond to American policy decisions that directly affect its most strategically important industry without the formal diplomatic channels that would be available to a recognised sovereign state. Taiwan's representative office in Washington has been in intensive contact with Commerce Department officials and congressional staff in recent weeks, according to people familiar with those exchanges, pressing for carve-outs or licensing exemptions that would protect Taiwanese companies' operations outside China from collateral restriction.

Minister of Economic Affairs Kuo Jyh-huei said at a press conference in Taipei on Friday that the government was "in active communication" with American counterparts and was confident that the final rule would reflect an understanding of Taiwan's unique position. He declined to characterise the private exchanges in detail. However, a Taiwanese industry lobbyist with direct knowledge of the discussions was considerably less sanguine. "Every time one of these rules comes out, there are promises that Taiwan's interests will be protected, and every time the final text contains ambiguities that take months of legal interpretation to resolve," the lobbyist said. "That uncertainty is itself a cost."

The anticipated controls arrive at a moment of significant stress for the broader semiconductor equipment and materials supply chain. Dutch firm ASML, whose extreme ultraviolet lithography machines are essential to the production of the most advanced chips and which has been subject to its own Dutch and American export controls since 2023, reported last month that order cancellations from Chinese customers had accelerated more sharply than anticipated in the fourth quarter, as Chinese chipmakers concluded that further equipment deliveries were unlikely to be approved. Japanese equipment makers Tokyo Electron and Shin-Etsu Chemical have reported similar dynamics.

China's response to successive rounds of American semiconductor restrictions has been a combination of accelerated domestic investment — the Chinese government has committed the equivalent of more than $150 billion to semiconductor industry development through various national funds since 2014 — and determined efforts to develop domestic alternatives to restricted tools and materials. American and Taiwanese officials and analysts assess that China has made meaningful progress in mature node fabrication and in some areas of packaging technology, though the consensus view remains that a gap of several years persists at the leading edge.

Mark Liu, the former chairman of TSMC who retired last year and who is widely regarded as one of the most authoritative voices on semiconductor geopolitics, said in a speech in Tokyo last month that the escalating control regime risked producing outcomes that neither Washington nor Taipei desired. "Restrictions accelerate Chinese self-sufficiency in areas where they were previously dependent," he said. "The calculation of whether that acceleration is outpaced by the denial of capability requires more precision than the policy process currently applies."

The Commerce Department is expected to open a public comment period following formal publication of the rule, during which affected companies and governments may submit responses. Industry lawyers in Washington said on Friday they anticipated the comment period would generate an unusually high volume of responses given the breadth of the anticipated rule's application.

Markets reacted cautiously. ASE shares fell 4.1 percent in Taipei trading on Friday, while TSMC declined 1.8 percent. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index closed down 2.3 percent in New York.
