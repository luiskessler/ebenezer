# Argentina's Milei Government Faces First Major Crisis as Peso Slides and Congress Blocks Privatisation Programme

**BUENOS AIRES, Feb. 21** — Argentine President Javier Milei's radical economic reform programme confronted its most serious political and financial test since he took office fourteen months ago as the peso fell 8.3 percent against the dollar in a single day of trading on Friday — its sharpest single-session decline since the controlled devaluation Milei ordered on his first day in office in December 2023 — after the Chamber of Deputies voted late Thursday night by 142 to 98 to block the privatisation of Aerolíneas Argentinas, the state airline, and the electricity transmission company Transener, stripping from the government's economic programme two of the most symbolically charged elements of what Milei has described as Argentina's liberation from what he calls the "parasitic state."

The congressional defeat, achieved through a coalition of Peronist opposition legislators, centre-left parties, and a bloc of provincial representatives from Patagonian districts where Aerolíneas Argentinas is the sole air link to the national network and whose governors had lobbied intensively against the privatisation, was the second significant legislative setback for the administration in a month, following the Chamber's rejection in January of proposed changes to the pension indexation formula. Together the defeats signal that the congressional arithmetic on which Milei's programme depends — narrow pluralities assembled vote by vote through a combination of fiscal inducements to provincial governments and the personal cultivation of centrist legislators — is proving more fragile than the administration had publicly acknowledged.

"The markets are saying what the administration doesn't want to hear," said Marina Dal Poggetto, director of the EcoGo consulting firm in Buenos Aires and one of Argentina's most closely followed macro economists, speaking to journalists on Friday. "The reform programme has real achievements, but its political foundation is thinner than it appeared, and when that becomes visible the exchange rate is the first thing to feel it."

The peso's decline on Friday — from 1,247 to 1,350 to the dollar in official market trading — was accompanied by a significant widening of the spread between the official rate and the parallel blue dollar market, which reached 1,510 by late afternoon, a gap whose expansion economists regard as an early warning signal of renewed currency instability of the kind that has destabilised Argentine governments with regularity for four decades. Central bank reserves, bolstered in recent months by a strong agricultural export season and by an $8 billion disbursement from the International Monetary Fund in November under a revised programme whose terms included the elimination of most currency controls, fell by an estimated $620 million on Friday as the central bank sold dollars to moderate the peso's decline — a pace of reserve consumption that analysts described as sustainable only in the very short term if maintained.

Economy Minister Luis Caputo held an emergency press conference in Buenos Aires on Friday afternoon at which he sought to project the administration's characteristic combination of ideological certainty and numerical granularity, presenting fiscal data showing that Argentina had achieved its first quarterly primary surplus in fifteen years in the October-December period and reiterating the government's commitment to a zero-deficit target for 2025 that he described as "non-negotiable and achievable regardless of congressional obstruction on the revenue side." He dismissed the peso's decline as "a market reaction to political noise rather than to fundamentals" and announced no new policy measures — a decision that several market participants interpreted as either genuine confidence or political inability to acknowledge the severity of the situation, with opinion divided on which.

Milei himself appeared at a rally in Córdoba on Friday evening where he had been scheduled to speak before the congressional vote occurred, and whose political character — jubilant, combative, delivered in the performative style that made him a phenomenon of Argentine politics before his election — jarred somewhat with the economic emergency unfolding simultaneously in Buenos Aires. He described the legislators who voted against privatisation as "the enemies of freedom and the servants of the caste" — his standard formulation for political opponents — and promised that Aerolíneas Argentinas would be privatised "by the end of this year, one way or another," without specifying what alternative mechanism he envisaged given the constitutional requirement for congressional approval of state asset sales.

The Aerolíneas privatisation has been particularly contentious because the airline's workers' union, the Asociación de Pilotos de Líneas Aéreas and the broader Unión del Personal Aeronáutico, mounted an unusually effective public campaign that combined industrial action — including a series of strikes that disrupted domestic air travel for weeks during the second half of last year — with an argument that Aerolíneas's role as a connector of remote Patagonian communities meant its privatisation would effectively end regular air service to regions already disadvantaged by geography and distance from the economic centre. That argument proved persuasive to enough Patagonian provincial legislators to deny the government its majority.

The Peronist opposition, whose political project was comprehensively rejected by Argentine voters in 2023 after years of economic mismanagement that left the country with 211 percent annual inflation at the moment of Milei's election, has used the legislative defeats to argue that its institutional presence in Congress represents a democratic check on what it characterises as Milei's authoritarian tendencies. Former president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, whose corruption conviction has been under appeal and whose political influence within Peronism has waxed and waned, posted a statement on social media Friday describing the vote as "a victory for the Argentine people over the ideological fanaticism of those who would sell the country piece by piece."

Milei's administration has achieved results that its supporters argue represent a genuine historical discontinuity in Argentine economic management. Annual inflation, while still extraordinarily high by international standards, has fallen from 211 percent at the moment of his election to approximately 84 percent in January — a dramatic deceleration achieved through a combination of fiscal adjustment, monetary tightening, and the freezing of certain administered prices that critics argue has merely deferred rather than resolved underlying price pressures. The fiscal primary surplus, the first in fifteen years, is a genuine achievement whose political cost in reduced public services has been substantial. Poverty rates, however, rose sharply through 2024 as real wages fell and government transfers were reduced, reaching approximately 53 percent of the population in the first half of the year before beginning to stabilise as inflation decelerated.

Whether the programme's macroeconomic achievements can be sustained through a period of political setback and currency pressure without the additional reforms — particularly the privatisation programme — that the government argues are essential to reducing the state's fiscal burden over the medium term, is the central question that markets are now beginning to price. The IMF, whose programme support has been critical to the administration's ability to rebuild reserves and manage the exchange rate, issued a statement on Friday expressing support for the government's fiscal framework and urging "continued implementation of the reform programme" — language that, read carefully, could be interpreted as both an endorsement and a warning.

The political calendar adds urgency to the economic question. Argentina's midterm congressional elections are scheduled for October, and the results of those elections will determine whether Milei's La Libertad Avanza movement can improve its congressional position sufficiently to advance the privatisation and deregulation programme that its legislative defeats have now visibly stalled. Polling conducted before Friday's events showed the administration's approval rating at approximately 43 percent — declining from its post-election highs but remaining above the levels that would suggest an immediate electoral crisis — though the events of the past 24 hours were likely to affect those numbers in ways that polling companies would not be able to capture for several days.

The congressional defeat and the peso's response had by Friday evening produced what Buenos Aires's political and financial commentators were calling the administration's first genuine crisis — a judgment that Milei's supporters contested and that his opponents, with the particular relish of those who have waited for confirmation of predictions they were told were alarmist, embraced with undisguised satisfaction.
