# Philippines Typhoon Karding Aftermath Exposes Disaster Preparedness Failures as Death Toll Reaches 312

**MANILA, Feb. 21** — The Philippine government faced mounting institutional accountability on Friday as the death toll from Typhoon Karding — the strongest storm to make landfall in the Philippines since Typhoon Odette in 2021 — rose to 312 confirmed fatalities eleven days after the system struck the Bicol region and southern Luzon with sustained winds of 195 kilometres per hour and a storm surge that inundated coastal communities to depths that survivors described as unprecedented in living memory, with congressional hearings underway in Manila producing testimony that documented a systematic failure of early warning dissemination, evacuation enforcement, and pre-positioning of emergency supplies that investigators said had transformed a survivable natural event into a mass casualty disaster.

The hearings, convened by the House Committee on Disaster Resilience and chaired by Representative Stella Quimbo of Marikina, entered their third day on Friday with testimony from the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council that contradicted statements made by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. in the storm's immediate aftermath, when he described the government response as "among the most prepared in Philippine history." Internal NDRRMC situation reports obtained through a congressional subpoena and entered into the hearing record showed that of the 47 municipalities in the storm's projected path that were assessed as requiring pre-emptive evacuation, 31 had received evacuation orders less than six hours before landfall — a timeframe that the agency's own operational standards specify as inadequate for the coastal populations most at risk from storm surge and who require twelve to eighteen hours to evacuate safely given the road infrastructure constraints of the Bicol peninsula.

"The gap between what was said publicly and what the documents show is not a matter of interpretation," said Representative Quimbo at Friday's session. "The documents show that warnings were delayed, that evacuation orders came too late, and that the supply caches that were supposed to be in place were not in place. Those are facts. The question is why, and who is accountable."

NDRRMC executive director Ariel Nepomuceno, who appeared before the committee under subpoena after declining two voluntary invitations, maintained under questioning that the agency had "acted within its operational parameters" and attributed the evacuation timeline failures primarily to local government units that had been slow to implement national directives. He insisted that the death toll, while deeply tragic, reflected the storm's exceptional intensity rather than institutional failure. Several committee members contested that characterisation vigorously, citing the NDRRMC's own pre-storm risk assessment, which had rated 23 of the 31 municipalities with delayed evacuation orders as "extreme risk" — the highest category in the agency's classification system — more than 48 hours before landfall.

A senior official within the Office of Civil Defense, speaking without authorisation, said the fundamental problem was not the warning timeline but the supply chain for emergency response resources. "We issued warnings," the official said. "What we did not have was the food, the water, the medicines, and the shelter materials in the right places before the storm hit. That is a resource and planning problem that has existed for years and that has been raised in after-action reviews of previous typhoons without producing the institutional changes required."

The supply chain failure was documented in detail by a joint assessment conducted by the Philippine Red Cross and the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, published on Thursday, which found that pre-positioned emergency stocks in the Bicol region covered approximately 23 percent of the affected population's immediate needs — against a national standard of 72-hour supply coverage for 100 percent of at-risk populations that the NDRRMC has formally committed to maintaining. The assessment attributed the shortfall to a combination of budget constraints, inadequate warehouse infrastructure in the region, and the diversion of regional stockpiles to respond to a separate flooding event in Mindanao three weeks before Karding's landfall that had not been fully replenished.

The political dimensions of the accountability process are complicated by the Marcos administration's domestic position. The president's approval ratings, which had been declining through the latter half of 2024 amid a cost of living crisis and the dramatic deterioration of his relationship with former ally and now bitter political opponent Vice President Sara Duterte — whose impeachment trial in the Senate is proceeding simultaneously with the typhoon hearings, consuming significant institutional attention — remained above 60 percent in the most recent published polling but had fallen 11 points since July. The typhoon's handling threatens further erosion among the rural and coastal populations of Bicol who form a significant component of the electoral coalition on which the Marcos political project depends.

Senator Imee Marcos, the president's sister and a figure of independent political influence within the family's network, departed from the administration's defensive posture on Friday in remarks to reporters that officials described as unauthorised, saying the congressional testimony had revealed "problems that are real and need to be honestly acknowledged rather than defensively explained away." Her statement was interpreted in Manila's political community as either a genuine assessment or a calculated move to insulate the Marcos family brand from the specific accountability of the NDRRMC and local government failures.

The storm's physical destruction in Bicol has been severe by any measure. Preliminary assessments by the Department of Public Works and Highways estimated infrastructure damage at 87 billion pesos, including the destruction of 34 bridges and the severe damage of road networks across an area whose connectivity was already marginal before the storm. Agricultural losses — primarily rice, coconut, and aquaculture — were estimated by the Department of Agriculture at 23 billion pesos, affecting a region where farm and fishing income provides the primary livelihood for approximately 60 percent of the workforce.

The coconut sector damage carries particular long-term significance. The Philippines is the world's second-largest coconut producer, and Bicol is among its most productive growing regions. Coconut palms require seven to ten years to reach productive maturity, meaning that the estimated 4.2 million trees destroyed or severely damaged by Karding's winds will not be replaced in the productive sense within this decade. The Philippine Coconut Authority estimated on Friday that the damage would reduce national coconut oil export capacity by approximately 15 percent for at least five years — a supply shock that coconut oil commodity markets had begun to price before the authority's formal assessment was published.

International humanitarian assistance has been substantial. Japan's government announced a $15 million emergency grant on Wednesday, the largest bilateral contribution to the relief effort. The United States deployed a Marine Expeditionary Unit with helicopter assets from its Okinawa-based forces within 72 hours of landfall, whose support for inland community reach in areas where roads were impassable was described by NDRRMC as "operationally significant." Australia, the European Union, and the Asian Development Bank have collectively committed approximately $40 million in emergency and early recovery funding.

The climate context of Karding's intensity has been addressed with varying degrees of directness by Philippine officials. Science and Technology Secretary Renato Solidum, a volcanologist and natural hazards specialist who has been more forthcoming than most cabinet members on climate attribution, said on Friday that the rapid intensification Karding underwent in the 36 hours before landfall — strengthening from a tropical storm to a Category 5-equivalent system in an unusually short timeframe — was "consistent with what our models project for typhoon behaviour in warming seas" and that the Philippines needed to redesign its disaster preparedness standards around storm scenarios significantly more severe than historical norms.

That redesign would require resources that the Philippine state has consistently struggled to allocate adequately. The NDRRMC's budget for the current fiscal year is approximately 1.8 billion pesos — a figure that disaster risk reduction specialists have repeatedly characterised as grossly insufficient for a country that experiences an average of twenty typhoons annually and that the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction ranks among the five most disaster-exposed nations on earth.

Whether the congressional hearings will produce institutional changes of the kind that previous typhoon accountability processes have consistently failed to generate, or whether they will follow the pattern of documented failure, brief political accountability, and structural continuity that has characterised Philippine disaster governance for decades, is a question whose answer depends on political will that observers in Manila on Friday assessed with familiar scepticism.

"After Ondoy, we said never again," said Julio Rinoza, a disaster risk researcher at the University of the Philippines Diliman, referring to the 2009 typhoon that killed nearly 500 people in Metro Manila. "After Yolanda, we said never again. After Odette, we said never again. The 'never again' is real when we say it. The institutional change is not."

The NDRRMC is scheduled to present its full after-action report to the congressional committee on March 7th.
