# Turkey's Kurdish Peace Process Fractures as PKK Splinter Faction Attacks Army Base in Diyarbakır

**ANKARA, Feb. 21** — Turkey's government suspended a nascent peace dialogue with imprisoned Kurdish leader Abdullah Öcalan on Friday after a faction of the Kurdistan Workers' Party operating under the name Teyrêbazên Azadiyê — the Hawks of Freedom — claimed responsibility for a pre-dawn attack on a Turkish army base outside Diyarbakır in which three soldiers were killed and eleven wounded by a combination of rocket-propelled grenade fire and a vehicle-borne explosive device, the deadliest assault on Turkish military personnel in the predominantly Kurdish southeast in fourteen months and one whose timing, coming six weeks into the most serious peace overture between the Turkish state and the PKK in a decade, appeared designed by its perpetrators precisely to destroy the political conditions that dialogue requires.

President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan convened an emergency session of the National Security Council in Ankara on Friday morning and issued a statement within two hours declaring that the attack "demonstrated the true face of those who claim to pursue peace while continuing to spill blood" and announcing the indefinite suspension of the dialogue process that his government had, with considerable political risk, initiated in December through back-channel contacts with Öcalan in his prison cell on İmralı Island in the Sea of Marmara, where the PKK's founding leader has been held since his capture in 1999. Erdoğan said Turkey's military and intelligence services would "respond to the attack with all necessary force" and that conditions for resumed dialogue would be reassessed only if the PKK's central command made "verifiable and irreversible" commitments to disarmament.

The peace process that the attack has suspended was itself a political event of significant complexity and fragility. Its initiation in December reflected a convergence of factors that analysts had described cautiously as creating unusual conditions for progress: Erdoğan's AKP party faces mounting electoral pressure, particularly in major urban centres, and had calculated that a peace dividend in the southeast could contribute to economic stabilisation and reduced security spending; the Kurdish political movement, represented in parliament by the DEM Party, had shown increasing willingness to engage constructively with state institutions following a period in which several of its mayors had been removed by government-appointed trustees; and Öcalan himself, now 76 and in deteriorating health, had through intermediaries signalled readiness to make a historic statement calling for the PKK's disarmament if political conditions were met.

A senior Turkish government official, speaking without authorisation because of the process's exceptional sensitivity, said on Friday that Öcalan had been informed of the attack and its consequences for the dialogue through his lawyers, who were permitted a monthly visit under the conditions of his imprisonment. The official said Öcalan's reaction had not yet been formally conveyed but that the government was "not yet prepared to conclude he was complicit or forewarned." The distinction mattered enormously for the process's future: if the attack was ordered by elements of the PKK command structure with Öcalan's knowledge, the dialogue's resumption would be politically inconceivable in any near-term timeframe; if it represented a genuine splinter action aimed at sabotaging a process that Öcalan himself supported, resumption remained theoretically possible once political conditions allowed.

The Teyrêbazên Azadiyê, which claimed responsibility in a statement posted to a Kurdish news agency website on Friday morning, described itself as operating independently of the PKK's main command structure and characterised its attack as a response to what it called the Turkish state's "pretence of peace while continuing the political persecution of Kurdish politicians and the military occupation of Kurdish regions in Syria." The group has claimed previous attacks, though none of the scale of Friday's, and its precise relationship to the PKK's Kandil-based leadership — which issues overall strategic direction from mountain bases on the Iraq-Iran border — is disputed among analysts, with some assessing it as a genuine operational splinter and others treating it as a front for deniable operations by the main organisation.

The PKK's main media outlet published a statement on Friday afternoon that neither claimed nor condemned the Diyarbakır attack — a studied ambiguity that Turkish officials and several independent analysts interpreted as more consistent with institutional embarrassment at an action that undermined a process the leadership had not fully opposed than with genuine ignorance of or opposition to it.

DEM Party co-chair Tülay Hatimoğulları issued an urgent statement condemning the attack and calling on all parties to "step back from the edge" and preserve conditions for dialogue. She expressed condolences to the families of the killed soldiers and said her party remained committed to a political solution. The statement's careful language — condemning the attack without attributing it to the PKK as an organisation — reflected the DEM Party's perennial difficulty of maintaining credibility with both the Kurdish electorate, significant portions of which retain sympathy for the PKK's historical project, and the Turkish political mainstream, which demands unambiguous condemnation of all PKK-affiliated violence as a precondition for treating Kurdish political parties as legitimate actors.

The government's opposition parties reacted in ways that reflected their respective political calculations. The main opposition Republican People's Party issued a statement expressing solidarity with the armed forces and calling for national unity against terrorism, declining to comment on the peace process whose suspension it has privately welcomed, having consistently argued that Erdoğan's dialogue initiative was a political manoeuvre rather than a genuine peace effort. The nationalist MHP, whose parliamentary support the AKP depends on and whose leader Devlet Bahçeli had unexpectedly endorsed the dialogue initiative in October — the political signal that many analysts identified as the decisive enabler of the process — issued a statement on Friday describing the attack as "a PKK provocation that must be met with the full force of the Turkish state" but stopping short of calling for a permanent termination of dialogue, language that observers interpreted as leaving a theoretical door open for Bahçeli to support resumption under changed conditions.

The regional dimensions of the Kurdish question complicate any straightforward path to resumption. Turkey's military operations in northern Syria, where it maintains significant forces and proxy armed groups in areas bordering Kurdish-controlled territory, have continued throughout the dialogue period and have been cited by Kurdish sources as evidence of Turkish bad faith. The Syrian Democratic Forces, the Kurdish-led military organisation that controls significant territory in northeastern Syria and that the United States has supported as its primary partner in counter-Islamic State operations, has watched the Turkey-PKK dialogue with a mixture of hope and suspicion, calculating that a genuine Turkish-Kurdish accommodation could reduce the military pressure it faces from Turkish-backed factions while also potentially reducing American incentives to maintain its protective military presence in the region.

American officials have followed the Turkish peace process with careful interest, welcoming it in general terms while acknowledging the deep structural obstacles to its success. A State Department spokesperson said on Friday that the United States "mourned the loss of Turkish soldiers" and urged "all parties to recommit to a peaceful resolution of long-standing conflicts." The statement's inclusion of "all parties" rather than a straightforward condemnation of the PKK alone was noted in Ankara as a nuance the Turkish government found unsatisfying.

In Diyarbakır, where the civilian population has lived with the consequences of the conflict's cycles of violence and ceasefire for decades, Friday's attack and the suspension of dialogue produced reactions that local journalists described as weary rather than surprised. The city's residents have watched multiple previous peace processes collapse at moments of apparent progress, and have developed a calibrated scepticism about political announcements from both Ankara and the Kurdish political movement that produces neither despair nor credulity when developments justify either.

"Every time something starts, something else finishes it," said one shopkeeper in Diyarbakır's old city, reached by telephone on Friday afternoon and declining to give his name. "We have learned not to feel too much at the beginning. It hurts less at the end."

The Turkish military launched air operations against PKK positions in northern Iraq on Friday evening, the defence ministry confirmed.
