# Venezuela's Opposition Calls General Strike as Maduro Government Seizes Opposition-Held Municipal Offices Overnight

**CARACAS, Feb. 21** — Venezuela's fragmented but resurgent opposition movement called for a nationwide general strike beginning Monday after government security forces and armed civilian groups loyal to President Nicolás Maduro conducted coordinated overnight operations across eleven municipalities in five states, forcibly removing elected opposition mayors and municipal council members from their offices, detaining four local officials, and installing government-appointed administrators in what opposition leaders described as a constitutional coup against the results of regional elections held last October in which the opposition had made its most significant municipal electoral gains since 2015.

The overnight operations, which began shortly after midnight on Thursday and were completed before dawn, were conducted without judicial orders according to documentation reviewed by opposition lawyers and by two independent Venezuelan legal scholars, and appeared to rely instead on an executive decree issued by the interior ministry on Wednesday evening that declared a state of "administrative emergency" in the affected municipalities, citing what the decree described as "systematic obstruction of national government programmes and infiltration of local administration by foreign-directed destabilisation networks" — allegations that the affected mayors and their legal representatives categorically rejected.

Opposition leader María Corina Machado, who has remained active within Venezuela despite an outstanding government arrest warrant, issued a video statement from an undisclosed location on Friday morning calling the operations "the clearest demonstration yet that Maduro's regime understands it cannot survive free and fair competition and has chosen naked force over democratic legitimacy." She called on Venezuelans to begin work stoppages on Monday, remain peaceful, and document every instance of government repression with video evidence for submission to international human rights bodies. She also called on the international community to move beyond statements of concern toward "concrete and immediate measures."

The Maduro government's response was delivered by Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello, the most powerful figure in the Venezuelan state after Maduro himself and a man whose relationship with the opposition is one of unvarnished hostility accumulated over more than two decades. At a press conference in Caracas on Friday morning, Cabello described the affected municipalities as "command centres for imperialist subversion" and said the administrative emergency decree was a lawful exercise of executive authority under Article 236 of the Venezuelan constitution — a characterisation that constitutional lawyers consulted by journalists on Friday said was "without legal foundation in any credible reading of that provision." He accused Machado of taking orders from Washington and said the general strike call was "a desperate act by people who know their American patrons are losing interest."

That last claim carries a degree of geopolitical context that complicates the international picture. The Trump administration, which in its first term applied maximum pressure sanctions to Venezuela and recognised opposition leader Juan Guaidó as interim president in 2019 — a recognition that ultimately produced no change in government — has in its second term shown a more transactional approach to Venezuelan policy, with administration officials holding back-channel discussions with Caracas representatives since December on a framework that would ease some sanctions in exchange for Venezuelan cooperation on migration management and the return of deportable Venezuelan nationals. Those discussions have not been publicly confirmed by either government but have been reported by three news organisations with sources in both capitals.

A senior American official familiar with the discussions, speaking on condition of strict anonymity, said the overnight municipal seizures had "severely complicated" the dialogue and that Washington was reassessing whether continued engagement with the Maduro government served American interests. The official said no decisions had been taken but that the administration was "not in a position to simply move on from what happened on Thursday night." The Venezuelan foreign ministry, which had characterised the back-channel conversations as evidence of American pragmatism replacing what it called ideological rigidity, issued no statement on Friday about the status of those contacts.

The four detained municipal officials — two mayors and two council members, from the states of Miranda, Carabobo, Zulia, and Mérida — had not been formally charged or brought before a judge as of Friday evening, according to their legal representatives, who said they had been denied access to their clients and did not know where they were being held. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights office in Caracas issued a statement calling for their immediate release and for information about their whereabouts, invoking Venezuela's obligations under international human rights law. The Venezuelan government did not respond to the statement.

Human rights organisations with long experience monitoring Venezuelan repression described the scale and simultaneity of Thursday's operations as reflecting a level of planning and coordination that suggested a deliberate strategic decision rather than a reactive response to specific local circumstances. "This was not improvised," said Tamara Taraciuk Broner, acting director for the Americas at Human Rights Watch, speaking by telephone on Friday. "Eleven municipalities across five states, simultaneously, overnight — that is an operation that was planned, resourced, and approved at the highest levels of the state."

The October municipal elections that produced the opposition gains now being reversed had themselves occurred in a compromised environment, with several opposition candidates barred from standing, independent domestic election observers denied accreditation, and international monitors from the European Union and Carter Center issuing reports noting significant irregularities while nonetheless acknowledging that opposition parties had made genuine gains in competitive races. The Maduro government had allowed the elections to proceed, analysts at the time suggested, partly to create an appearance of democratic normalcy as it sought sanctions relief and partly because it had calculated the opposition's gains would be manageable. The decision to reverse those gains through force suggests that calculation was revised.

Regional reactions divided along predictable ideological lines. Colombia's President Gustavo Petro, who has maintained a dialogue with Maduro despite domestic criticism and who has served as an informal intermediary between Caracas and Washington, issued an unusually pointed statement on Friday saying the overnight operations were "incompatible with the democratic norms that Venezuela's government has itself invoked when it suited it" and calling for the reinstatement of elected officials. Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, another leader who has pursued engagement with Caracas while maintaining rhetorical distance from its most authoritarian acts, said through a spokesperson that Brazil was "following events with concern" and called for dialogue — a formulation that opposition figures described as inadequate and that Caracas received without comment.

Cuba, Nicaragua, and Bolivia offered statements of support for the Maduro government's actions, framing them within the familiar register of anti-imperialist sovereignty that has provided the ideological architecture for left-authoritarian governments in the region for decades.

Inside Venezuela, the mood in the affected municipalities was described by residents and local journalists reached by telephone on Friday as a mixture of anger, fear, and the particular exhaustion of people who have watched political hope emerge and be crushed with regularity over the past decade. In Chacao, a municipality in the Caracas metropolitan area and one of those from which an opposition mayor had been removed, small groups of residents gathered outside the municipal building on Friday morning before being dispersed by national police using tear gas.

Whether Monday's general strike would achieve significant participation was a question that Venezuelan opposition figures, reflecting on the mixed results of previous strike calls in a country where economic devastation has left many workers unable to absorb a day's lost wages, answered with careful rather than confident optimism.

"People are angry," said one opposition municipal official who had not been among those detained, speaking by telephone from an undisclosed location. "Whether anger is enough to make them act when acting is dangerous — that is the question we have never fully been able to answer."
