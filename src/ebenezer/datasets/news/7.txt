# Canada Faces Mounting Pressure Over Arctic Sovereignty as US Military Flights Test Northern Air Boundaries

**OTTAWA, Feb. 21** — Canada's government summoned the United States chargé d'affaires to the foreign ministry on Friday after American military aircraft conducted what Ottawa described as "uncoordinated overflight activity" in airspace above the Beaufort Sea and the archipelago north of Banks Island on at least three occasions in the past ten days, in incidents that senior Canadian officials characterised as deliberate provocations linked to the Trump administration's repeated public assertions that Canada's Arctic sovereignty claims are negotiable.

The summons, confirmed by Global Affairs Canada in a brief statement released Friday afternoon, marked the most formal diplomatic protest Canada has lodged against the United States since the current period of bilateral tension began in January, when President Donald Trump renewed suggestions, initially made during the transition period, that Canada might ultimately become the 51st American state and questioned the validity of the 1985 Arctic Waters Pollution Prevention Act as a basis for Canadian jurisdiction over the Northwest Passage. Ottawa considers the Passage internal waters subject to full Canadian sovereignty. Washington has long maintained it is an international strait through which vessels of all nations enjoy right of transit passage — a disagreement that has simmered for decades but that the current American administration has elevated from a chronic diplomatic irritant to an active pressure point.

"Canada's sovereignty over its Arctic territory and waters is not a matter for negotiation, not with the United States, not with anyone," Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly said at a press conference in Ottawa on Friday, her voice visibly taut. "What has occurred in the past ten days is not routine. It is not an accident. And it will not be treated as one."

A spokesperson for the US Embassy in Ottawa declined to confirm or deny that the flights had occurred, saying only that American military operations were "conducted in accordance with international law and longstanding US policy regarding freedom of navigation and overflight." The Pentagon did not respond to a request for comment by the time of publication.

The precise nature of the overflights remains partially unclear. Two Canadian officials familiar with the incidents, both speaking without authorisation to discuss operational matters publicly, said the aircraft involved were identified as US Air Force RC-135 reconnaissance variants and that on at least one occasion a Canadian Forces CF-18 was scrambled from CFB Cold Lake to intercept and shadow the American aircraft. The officials said the US aircraft had not filed flight plans with Nav Canada covering the specific routing flown and had not responded on standard communication frequencies when initially contacted.

A senior defence official in Ottawa, also speaking anonymously, described the pattern as consistent with what military planners call "probing activity" — operations designed to test response times, procedures, and political reactions rather than to achieve a specific tactical objective. "This is not how allies behave," the official said. "Or rather, it is not how allies have historically behaved. We are in a different moment."

The incidents have ignited significant domestic political pressure on Prime Minister Mark Carney, who took office three weeks ago following Justin Trudeau's resignation and who has made reasserting Canadian sovereignty in the face of American pressure a central theme of his early administration. Carney, a former Bank of England and Bank of Canada governor with no prior elected experience, has moved quickly to project firmness on the sovereignty file, announcing last week a CAD $6.1 billion acceleration of Arctic defence investment that includes additional radar infrastructure under the North Warning System replacement programme and a commitment to basing a second offshore patrol vessel in Resolute Bay year-round beginning in 2027.

Opposition Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, whose party leads in polls ahead of a federal election expected before late April, accused the Carney government on Friday of having been caught flat-footed. "Canadians are asking why we learned about American military aircraft in our Arctic from news reports rather than from a government that had a plan," he said in a statement. Carney's office pushed back, saying the government had been tracking the situation in real time and that the decision to issue a formal summons reflected a deliberate and calibrated response rather than a reactive one.

The Arctic sovereignty dispute has drawn renewed international attention in recent months as accelerating sea ice loss opens previously inaccessible shipping lanes and resource extraction zones across the High North. The Northwest Passage, largely unnavigable for commercial shipping as recently as two decades ago, recorded its longest ice-free season on record last summer, a development that has sharpened commercial and strategic interest from shipping companies, resource firms, and navies across multiple continents.

Russia, which has dramatically expanded its own Arctic military infrastructure in recent years and which lodged its own extended continental shelf claim with the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf last year, has watched the Canada-US friction with what analysts describe as barely concealed satisfaction. China, which designated itself a "near-Arctic state" in a 2018 white paper and has pursued icebreaker construction and polar research investment at significant pace, has also expressed formal interest in the legal status of Arctic shipping lanes.

Michael Byers, a professor of international law and Arctic policy at the University of British Columbia who has advised successive Canadian governments on northern sovereignty matters, said the current situation was without modern precedent. "We have had this disagreement with the Americans for forty years," he said. "What is new is that the disagreement is now being prosecuted actively and publicly by an American administration that has explicitly signalled it does not consider Canada's position legitimate. That changes the legal and political dynamics in ways we have not had to navigate before."

The Canadian government indicated it would raise the overflight incidents at a NATO council session in Brussels next week, arguing that alliance norms regarding coordination of military activities among members had been violated. Whether NATO allies — several of whom are simultaneously managing their own tense bilateral relationships with Washington over trade and defence spending — would be willing to formally endorse that characterisation remains uncertain.

Joly said Canada had requested a written explanation from the US side within 72 hours.
