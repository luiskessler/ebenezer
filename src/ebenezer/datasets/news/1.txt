Sudan Peace Talks Stall as Famine Conditions Spread Across Darfur

ADDIS ABABA, Feb. 21 — African Union-brokered negotiations aimed at halting nineteen months of devastating civil war in Sudan collapsed for the third time in five weeks on Thursday after the Sudanese Armed Forces withdrew its delegation from talks in the Ethiopian capital, citing what it called "deliberate obstruction" by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces ahead of a scheduled ceasefire framework agreement.

The breakdown came as United Nations agencies warned that famine conditions, already confirmed in five areas of North Darfur last August, had spread to at least three additional localities in the past month, threatening an estimated 700,000 civilians who aid workers say have had almost no access to external assistance since RSF forces tightened their hold on supply corridors leading into El Fasher, the region's last major city not under paramilitary control.

"We are watching a manufactured famine unfold in real time," said Edem Wosornu, Director of Operations at the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, speaking to reporters in Geneva on Wednesday. "Every day that these negotiations fail to produce a humanitarian access arrangement is a day that people die who did not have to die."

The SAF's withdrawal was announced in a brief statement issued by Brigadier General Nabil Abdallah, a military spokesman, who accused RSF commanders of arriving at Thursday's session having already agreed to a separate set of terms with "external parties" whose identity he declined to specify. The accusation could not be independently verified.

RSF representatives denied the claim. The force's political director, Ibrahim Jabir Ishaq, told the pan-Arab network Al Arabiya on Thursday evening that the SAF had "manufactured a pretext" for leaving the table, insisting that RSF leadership remained committed to a framework that would allow unimpeded humanitarian corridors into Darfur within 72 hours of any signed agreement. However, a senior AU mediator, speaking on condition of anonymity because the talks are ongoing, warned that trust between the two delegations had deteriorated to a degree that made even a narrow humanitarian accord unlikely before the end of February.

"We are not at zero, but we are close," the official said. "Both sides are more interested in their battlefield positions than in what is happening to civilians."

The collapse landed with immediate diplomatic consequences. The United States special envoy for Sudan, Tom Perriello, had been scheduled to travel to Addis Ababa early next week to press both parties toward a signature. A State Department spokesperson confirmed on Thursday that the visit was under review, saying Washington was "deeply troubled" by the SAF withdrawal and urging an immediate return to talks. The European Union, which has pledged roughly €270 million in humanitarian assistance to Sudan since the war began in April 2023, issued a joint statement with the United Kingdom calling the breakdown "unconscionable" and warning that further aid disbursements could be conditioned on evidence of good-faith engagement from both parties.

The war began on April 15, 2023, when fighting erupted between the SAF and the RSF — a force that grew out of the Janjaweed militias implicated in mass atrocities in Darfur during the early 2000s — following a breakdown in negotiations over the integration of paramilitary units into the national army as part of a broader democratic transition. Since then, the conflict has killed an estimated 150,000 people, according to figures compiled last month by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project, and displaced more than ten million, producing what the UN has described as the world's largest displacement crisis.

Despite repeated international calls for accountability, neither side has faced binding legal consequences. The International Criminal Court, which holds outstanding warrants related to earlier Darfur atrocities against former president Omar al-Bashir and others, confirmed in a statement last week that its prosecutor's office was "actively gathering evidence" related to alleged war crimes committed by both parties since April 2023, though a formal investigation has yet to be announced.

Inside El Fasher, conditions have become extreme. Médecins Sans Frontières reported on Tuesday that its field teams had recorded a severe acute malnutrition rate among children under five of 27 percent at one site in the city's southern districts — a figure that, if confirmed across the broader population, would represent one of the worst nutritional emergencies documented anywhere in the world in the past decade.

Mohamed Osman, Sudan researcher at Human Rights Watch, said the international community bore responsibility for the pace at which the crisis had been allowed to deepen. "Nineteen months in, we still do not have a functioning humanitarian mechanism, we still do not have meaningful sanctions on commanders directing attacks against civilians, and we still do not have a political process that either party feels genuinely compelled to respect," he said. "The architecture of response has been inadequate from the beginning."

AU Commission officials said late Thursday they were working to reschedule a plenary session and expected both delegations to return to the table no earlier than next Tuesday.
