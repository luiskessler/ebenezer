Germany's Coalition Talks Enter Critical Phase as SPD Demands Debt Brake Reform in Exchange for Budget Concessions

BERLIN, Feb. 21 — Negotiations to form a governing coalition in Germany entered a decisive and increasingly fractious stage on Friday, as the Social Democrats formally tabled a demand that any coalition agreement with the conservative CDU/CSU bloc include a constitutionally significant loosening of the country's debt brake — the balanced-budget rule that has shaped German fiscal policy for fifteen years and that the CDU has long treated as a near-sacred commitment to financial discipline.

The demand, delivered in writing to CDU negotiators late Thursday evening and confirmed by SPD sources on Friday morning, threatens to unravel weeks of painstaking progress toward a governing majority following the federal election of February 23, in which Friedrich Merz's CDU/CSU emerged as the largest party with 28.6 percent of the vote but fell well short of a parliamentary majority. The SPD, which suffered its worst postwar result with 16.4 percent, has nonetheless found itself in the position of indispensable coalition partner after talks between the conservatives and the Greens collapsed last week over disagreements on migration and climate spending.

"The debt brake in its current form is incompatible with the investments Germany needs to remain competitive in the next decade," said Saskia Esken, the SPD co-leader, speaking to journalists outside the party's Willy-Brandt-Haus headquarters in Berlin on Friday. "We are not asking for fiscal irresponsibility. We are asking for the legal framework to do what every serious economist says is necessary."

Merz responded with characteristic bluntness at a separate press conference, calling the SPD's written demand "a line that cannot be crossed in the form presented" and reiterating that the CDU had received a mandate to restore fiscal credibility after what he described as the Scholz government's years of budgetary improvisation. He did not, however, rule out further discussions on the issue, and a senior CDU official, speaking on condition of anonymity because internal deliberations are ongoing, said privately that a narrow reform — one that created a specific exemption for defence spending rather than broadly loosening the cap — remained "theoretically discussable" if the SPD was willing to accept significant concessions elsewhere.

The debt brake, enshrined in the Basic Law in 2009, limits the federal government's structural deficit to 0.35 percent of gross domestic product. Its defenders argue it has provided Germany with the fiscal buffers that allowed emergency spending during the COVID-19 pandemic and the energy crisis triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Its critics, increasingly vocal in recent months, contend that it has starved the German state of the investment needed to modernise ageing infrastructure, accelerate the energy transition, and meet NATO's defence spending target of two percent of GDP — a threshold Germany has consistently struggled to reach.

The pressure on that last point has intensified sharply since January, when US President Donald Trump renewed demands that European NATO members dramatically increase their defence contributions and suggested, in a series of statements that unnerved European capitals, that the United States could not be relied upon to fulfil Article 5 commitments unconditionally. Germany's defence budget, at approximately 1.9 percent of GDP last year, remains below the NATO target despite significant increases following Russia's 2022 invasion.

A compromise proposal circulating among negotiators this week would create a new off-budget special fund — similar to the €100 billion Sondervermögen established for the Bundeswehr in 2022 — dedicated to defence and critical infrastructure investment, without formally amending the debt brake's constitutional text. The SPD has so far rejected this approach as cosmetically insufficient. The CDU has privately acknowledged its appeal precisely because it would avoid the two-thirds parliamentary majority required for a constitutional amendment, a threshold that would require support from either the Greens or the far-right Alternative für Deutschland, neither of which the conservatives are willing to formally approach for this purpose.

While both parties have maintained a public posture of cautious optimism about the talks' overall trajectory, the mood among negotiating teams on Friday was described by three people with direct knowledge of the discussions as "significantly more tense than it has been at any point in the past three weeks."

The timeline is not unlimited. Germany has been governed by a caretaker administration since the collapse of the three-party Ampel coalition in November, and senior civil servants have warned in recent weeks that several critical funding decisions — including tranches of support to Ukraine and commitments to European infrastructure programmes — cannot be legally authorised without a functioning government in possession of a full budget mandate.

Jörg Kukies, who served as finance state secretary under the Scholz government and is now advising the SPD negotiating team, declined to comment on the specifics of Thursday's written demand but said the fiscal question was "genuinely existential" for the country's medium-term position. However, Marcel Fratzscher, president of the German Institute for Economic Research, warned that an excessively rapid dismantling of the debt brake carried its own risks. "Markets have priced German debt on the assumption of fiscal conservatism," he said. "Any reform needs to be structured carefully or you risk exactly the kind of confidence shock you are trying to prevent."

A further round of plenary talks is scheduled for Sunday. Both parties have set an informal deadline of March 7 to reach a framework agreement, after which, negotiators on both sides privately acknowledge, the political costs of failure begin to rise steeply.
