# Montenegro's EU Accession Talks Collapse as Organised Crime Allegations Engulf Justice Ministry

**PODGORICA, Feb. 21** — Montenegro's decade-long European Union accession process ground to an effective halt on Friday after the European Commission suspended a critical cluster of rule-of-law negotiating chapters following the publication of an internal assessment concluding that the country's justice ministry had been systematically infiltrated by networks connected to organised crime groups, with the assessment — whose contents were described to journalists by three EU officials and one Montenegrin government source — alleging that at least six senior ministry officials had received payments from criminal organisations in exchange for manipulating prosecutorial appointments, suppressing indictments, and providing advance warning of law enforcement operations to suspects under investigation.

The suspension, the most serious setback in the history of any EU candidate country's accession process, was communicated to Podgorica in a confidential letter delivered to Prime Minister Milojko Spajić's office on Thursday evening and confirmed by the European Commission's enlargement directorate in Brussels on Friday in a statement whose language — "a fundamental and documented failure of the rule of law architecture that the accession process requires as its foundation" — represented a departure from the careful diplomatic hedging that normally characterises the Commission's public communications with candidate governments.

EU Enlargement Commissioner Marta Kos, who has championed an accelerated Western Balkans accession timeline as a geopolitical imperative given Russian and Chinese influence in the region, appeared before the European Parliament's foreign affairs committee on Friday morning in a session that had been scheduled for other business and that was abruptly redirected to the Montenegro situation, where she acknowledged the suspension with visible reluctance, describing it as "a decision taken with great regret and no satisfaction" and framing it as a necessary institutional response rather than an abandonment of Montenegro's European future. "The door remains open," she said. "But what is behind it must be worthy of what the door leads to."

The criminal infiltration allegations centre primarily on the period between 2020 and 2024, when Montenegro was governed by a succession of coalition governments whose instability — the country had four prime ministers in four years — created conditions that investigators described as conducive to the penetration of ministerial appointments by non-state actors with the financial resources and political connections to exploit governmental fragmentation. Montenegro's long-dominant Democratic Party of Socialists, which ruled the country for thirty years under former president and prime minister Milo Đukanović before losing its parliamentary majority in 2020, has been accused in the assessment of having established the original networks of criminal-political patronage that subsequent coalition governments then inherited and, allegedly, continued to exploit.

Đukanović, who served as president until 2023 and who remains a significant power within Montenegrin politics despite his formal departure from executive office, rejected the allegations on Friday as "a politically motivated European intervention in Montenegro's internal affairs designed to serve the agenda of those who wish to reverse the democratic changes of 2020." His party issued a statement pointing out that the assessment covered a period in which the DPS was in opposition, arguing that responsibility for any infiltration lay with the coalition governments that had replaced it — a defence that EU officials privately described as "technically narrow and substantively unconvincing given the structural continuities involved."

The specific individuals identified in the Commission's assessment have not been named in public communications, though Montenegrin media published Friday afternoon what they described as partial lists of the officials concerned, citing unnamed sources in Brussels. The justice ministry's current leadership, appointed under Spajić's government, issued a statement saying it had not been aware of the assessment's contents before Thursday's letter and was "committed to full cooperation with all investigative processes" while reserving the right to challenge findings it described as "procedurally irregular in their development."

For Montenegro, which opened accession negotiations in 2012 and which has for most of the intervening period been described as the most advanced candidate in the Western Balkans, Friday's suspension represents an institutional humiliation whose geopolitical dimensions extend well beyond the bilateral relationship with Brussels. The country's strategic significance — a NATO member since 2017 that sits at the junction of the Adriatic coast, provides critical alliance access, and borders Serbia, Bosnia, Albania, Kosovo, and Croatia — has made its European trajectory a matter of interest to multiple external actors, including Russia, which has historically maintained significant economic and cultural influence in Montenegro and which experienced a definitive rupture with the Đukanović government in 2016 when a Russian-linked coup attempt to prevent NATO membership was thwarted.

Russian state media and social media accounts aligned with Moscow's foreign influence operations responded to Friday's announcement with what disinformation analysts described as unusual speed and coordination, framing the suspension as evidence of European double standards and describing Montenegro as a victim of EU bureaucratic imperialism — a narrative that researchers at the Digital Forensics Research Lab said was being amplified through networks previously associated with Kremlin-linked influence operations in the Western Balkans.

Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić, whose country's own EU accession process has been effectively frozen for years over rule-of-law and Kosovo-related concerns, offered a statement of public sympathy for Montenegro's situation that EU officials in Brussels described privately as "strategically calibrated to normalise the kind of criminal-political entanglement that the Commission is trying to root out." The relationship between Serbian organised crime networks and their Montenegrin counterparts has been a persistent concern in EU enlargement assessments, with the Kavač and Škaljari criminal clans — whose violent rivalry has produced dozens of murders across the Western Balkans and in Western Europe over the past decade — understood to have significant operational presence in both countries.

The practical consequences of the suspension for Montenegro's population are considerable. EU accession has served as the organising framework for virtually every significant reform undertaken by successive Montenegrin governments, from judicial restructuring and anti-corruption legislation to public administration reform and alignment with EU standards in areas from food safety to environmental regulation. The suspension removes the accession conditionality that has been the primary external lever for driving those reforms, creating what one Brussels-based diplomat described as "a governance vacuum at exactly the moment when governance capacity is what is most urgently needed."

Montenegrin civil society organisations reacted to Friday's announcement with a mixture of anger at the government and concern about the suspension's consequences for reform momentum. Milena Milošević, programme director at the Institute Alternative, a Podgorica-based governance think tank, said the Commission's decision was justified by the evidence but needed to be accompanied by intensified technical assistance rather than simple disengagement. "Suspension without support produces collapse, not reform," she said. "If Europe walks away from Montenegro's institutions, it creates the vacuum that the criminal networks and Russia's influence operations are perfectly positioned to fill."

The Commission's letter to Podgorica specified three conditions for resumption of the suspended chapters: the commencement of criminal proceedings against the officials identified in the assessment, the appointment of an independent external monitor with full access to justice ministry operations, and the passage of a revised judicial appointments law removing the ministry's discretionary authority over prosecutorial selection that the assessment identified as the structural vulnerability most exploited by criminal networks. Whether Spajić's government, which commands a narrow parliamentary majority and whose coalition includes parties with their own complex relationships to the patronage networks now under scrutiny, could deliver all three conditions in the timeframe Brussels was implicitly demanding was regarded by most observers in Podgorica on Friday as genuinely uncertain.

A senior Montenegrin government official, speaking privately, said the administration was "in a state of shock" and was assessing the Commission's conditions "with complete seriousness and complete uncertainty about what is politically achievable." The official said Spajić had convened an emergency cabinet session for Saturday morning.

The EU's next Western Balkans progress report is scheduled for May.
