Kenyan Central Bank Raises Rates Sharply as Shilling Slides and IMF Talks Stall Over Fiscal Targets

NAIROBI, Feb. 21 — Kenya's central bank raised its benchmark lending rate by 125 basis points to 14.25 percent on Friday in an emergency out-of-cycle decision, as the Kenyan shilling fell to its weakest level against the dollar in eleven months and negotiations with the International Monetary Fund over the disbursement of a critical $606 million loan tranche entered what officials on both sides privately described as a state of serious difficulty.

The Monetary Policy Committee's unscheduled decision, announced in a brief statement released shortly before midday Nairobi time, cited "intensified exchange rate pressures" and "a deterioration in inflation expectations" driven in part by a sharp rise in global oil prices and in part by what the committee described as "uncertainty regarding the near-term fiscal position of the government." The shilling had fallen 6.3 percent against the dollar in the preceding three weeks, touching 136.40 to the dollar on Friday morning before recovering slightly following the rate announcement.

The move came after days of mounting signals that Kenya's ninth review under its $3.6 billion Extended Fund Facility with the IMF — originally expected to conclude in January — had failed to reach agreement on several structural benchmarks, including targets related to tax revenue collection and the pace of reduction in pending bills owed by the government to private contractors. Those pending bills, which the Treasury has acknowledged exceed 500 billion Kenyan shillings, have become a significant source of financial system stress, with several mid-tier commercial banks reporting elevated non-performing loan ratios in recent quarterly disclosures.

"The rate decision was necessary and it was correct, but it addresses the symptom rather than the cause," said Razia Khan, chief Africa economist at Standard Chartered, speaking by telephone from London on Friday. "The underlying issue is a fiscal credibility problem, and that is not something monetary policy can resolve on its own."

The IMF declined to comment on the status of the review, citing its standard policy of not discussing ongoing programme negotiations. However, a person familiar with the state of the discussions, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks are confidential, said Fund staff had expressed particular concern about revenue shortfalls in the first half of Kenya's current fiscal year, which runs to June, and about what the person characterised as a lack of specificity in the government's proposed corrective measures. "There is a gap between what has been promised and what has been demonstrated," the person said.

The Kenya Revenue Authority has collected approximately 94 percent of its target through the first seven months of the fiscal year, a shortfall that Treasury officials have attributed to weaker-than-expected economic activity following a period of intense civil unrest last year. Mass protests in June and July 2024, triggered by proposed tax increases in the Finance Bill that were ultimately withdrawn after demonstrators stormed and partially burned the parliament building, forced President William Ruto's administration to abandon several revenue measures it had built into its fiscal projections. The government subsequently sought to identify alternative revenue sources and expenditure cuts, but economists and opposition figures have argued that the adjustments have been insufficient and inconsistently applied.

Treasury Cabinet Secretary John Mbadi insisted on Friday that the government remained committed to its IMF programme and that the review would conclude successfully. "We are in active and constructive engagement with the Fund," he said in a statement. "Kenya has met the substantial majority of its commitments and we are confident that outstanding issues will be resolved in short order." However, two senior Treasury officials, speaking separately and without authorisation, acknowledged that the timeline for concluding the review had slipped significantly and that a disbursement before the end of March was no longer certain.

The consequences of a prolonged delay or programme suspension would be substantial. Kenya faces external debt repayments of approximately $2.1 billion in the twelve months to June 2026, including a Eurobond maturity, and relies heavily on continued access to multilateral financing to manage its external position. The country's foreign exchange reserves stood at $8.1 billion as of last week, equivalent to approximately 4.2 months of import cover — above the conventional adequacy threshold of three months but meaningfully below the levels that analysts consider comfortable given Kenya's financing needs.

Credit rating agency Moody's placed Kenya's sovereign rating on review for downgrade in January, citing fiscal slippage and refinancing risk. S&P has maintained a stable outlook but warned in its most recent assessment that the outlook could shift if programme relations with the IMF deteriorated.

The political context has complicated the government's room for manoeuvre. Ruto, who came to power in 2022 on a platform of support for small-scale farmers and low-income households, faces the difficult task of implementing austerity measures without further inflaming a population whose tolerance for economic pain was visibly exhausted by last year's protests. A junior coalition partner, the Orange Democratic Movement of former prime minister Raila Odinga, has in recent weeks signalled growing discomfort with the pace of fiscal adjustment, with several ODM legislators publicly opposing proposed cuts to agricultural subsidies.

Despite the political pressures, Kenya's finance ministry submitted a supplementary budget to parliament last week that included expenditure reductions of approximately 50 billion shillings, primarily affecting development spending. Opposition economists argued the cuts fell disproportionately on capital investment while protecting recurrent expenditures that they contended were more amenable to rationalisation.

David Ndii, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, pushed back against characterisations of the government's position as weak. "Kenya has navigated severe external shocks from a position of macroeconomic fundamentals that remain sounder than the commentary suggests," he said in a post on social media platform X on Thursday. Analysts, however, noted that the shilling's slide and the central bank's emergency response told a different story.

Markets will be watching closely next week when the Treasury is expected to hold a regular Treasury bill auction that will provide an early test of domestic investor appetite at the new rate environment.
