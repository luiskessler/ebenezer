# Mozambique's Post-Election Violence Leaves 200 Dead as Southern African Mediators Fail to Broker Political Settlement

**MAPUTO, Feb. 21** — Mozambique's political crisis, which erupted following disputed elections last October in which the ruling Frelimo party claimed a victory that independent observers and the main opposition candidate Venâncio Mondlane described as fraudulently inflated, entered its fourth month on Friday with a death toll that human rights monitors revised upward to at least 200 killed in security force operations against protesters, a figure that the Mozambican government disputed and that the United Nations Human Rights Office described as "a conservative estimate given the significant access restrictions that have prevented systematic documentation across affected areas."

The toll, compiled by the civic monitoring platform Plataforma DECIDE and cross-referenced against hospital records, morgue data, and witness testimony gathered by Human Rights Watch, includes at least 34 people killed in the past two weeks alone, indicating that violence has not subsided despite a Supreme Court ruling in late December that confirmed Frelimo candidate Daniel Chapo's election victory with a reduced margin — a decision that Mondlane, who has directed the protest movement from exile through social media livestreams watched by hundreds of thousands of Mozambicans daily, described as "a judicial endorsement of theft" and that served as the trigger for a further intensification of demonstrations rather than their demobilisation.

"What we are documenting is a pattern of lethal force used systematically against civilian protesters in circumstances where lethal force was not justified," said Zenaida Machado, Human Rights Watch's Mozambique researcher, in a statement on Friday. "Security forces have fired live ammunition into crowds, conducted targeted killings of protest organisers, and in several documented cases pursued and shot individuals who were fleeing, not threatening."

The Mozambican government's spokesperson, Inocêncio Impissa, rejected the characterisation on Friday, saying security forces had acted with "proportionate restraint" in the face of what he described as organised violence by "criminal elements exploiting political grievances" and pointing to the deaths of fourteen police officers during the unrest as evidence that security personnel were not operating against peaceful protesters. He cited an official death toll of 87 — confined to individuals killed during violent incidents rather than the broader documentation compiled by civil society organisations — and accused international human rights monitors of presenting a "systematically distorted" picture of events.

The political roots of the crisis lie in an election whose conduct raised serious questions from the moment voting concluded. The Carter Center, the European Union observation mission, and the African Union's observer team all published reports noting significant irregularities in the results tabulation process, including discrepancies between polling station results recorded by domestic observers and the national tally announced by Mozambique's National Elections Commission. The gap between Mondlane's own parallel count and the official result — officially recorded as a Frelimo victory of 70.7 percent against Mondlane's 20 percent, compared with a civil society parallel count suggesting a much narrower result — has never been satisfactorily explained by authorities.

Mondlane, a former Frelimo member who was expelled from the party and whose political organisation Podemos was barred from participating under its own name due to registration challenges, has emerged as a phenomenon of Mozambican political life whose significance extends beyond conventional opposition politics. His daily and sometimes multiple-times-daily social media livestreams, conducted from locations in various European countries, have created a direct communication channel with his supporters that bypasses state media entirely and that the government has attempted to disrupt through internet throttling and periodic shutdowns that have been documented by the digital rights organisation NetBlocks.

The Southern African Development Community, whose mediation of the crisis has been the principal regional diplomatic mechanism, convened its fourth extraordinary summit on Mozambique on Thursday in Harare, producing a communiqué that called on all parties to "engage in inclusive dialogue" and appointed a three-country mediation team composed of representatives from Tanzania, Botswana, and Zimbabwe. The communiqué was described by opposition figures and civil society organisations as inadequate to the situation's severity, and by the Mozambican government as affirming its legitimacy through the SADC process.

A senior SADC official involved in the mediation, speaking without authorisation, said the fundamental obstacle to progress was Mondlane's refusal to engage with any process that began from the premise of Chapo's legitimate presidency. "He will not sit at a table that accepts the election results as its starting point," the official said. "And Frelimo will not sit at a table that does not. That is not a negotiating gap. That is a categorical incompatibility."

Mondlane's position has not softened. In a livestream on Thursday evening watched by an estimated 400,000 viewers, he called for a continuation of economic disruption tactics including periodic national strikes that have been observed with significant compliance in Maputo and in the northern provinces of Cabo Delgado and Nampula and that have imposed measurable costs on an economy already under severe pressure. He announced a further national work stoppage for Monday and called on Mozambicans to "make the cost of stolen power more than those who stole it are willing to pay."

The economic consequences of four months of instability have begun to register in data. The metical has depreciated approximately 18 percent against the dollar since October, Mozambique's central bank has intervened repeatedly to slow the decline, and the tourism sector — which had been recovering strongly following the COVID-19 period — reported booking cancellations for the February-April peak season running at more than 60 percent of normal levels. Several international mining companies with operations in Mozambique's coal-producing Tete province have implemented security protocols that have reduced operational efficiency, and two junior exploration companies have suspended field operations entirely.

The situation in Cabo Delgado, the northern province where an Islamic State-linked insurgency has killed more than 6,000 people and displaced nearly one million since 2017 and where the government has been conducting operations with Rwandan and SADC military support since 2021, adds a further layer of fragility. Security analysts expressed concern on Friday that political instability at the national level could affect the coherence of counter-insurgency operations in the north, and that insurgent commanders might seek to exploit the government's divided attention. A Rwandan military spokesperson said its forces in Cabo Delgado were "maintaining full operational tempo" and that the political situation in Maputo had not affected their mission.

The international financial community has watched the crisis with growing concern. The International Monetary Fund, which suspended a credit facility with Mozambique in 2016 following the revelation of $2 billion in hidden debts — the "tuna bond" scandal that remains one of the most egregious sovereign fraud cases in African financial history — had been in discussions with the new government about a resumption of programme support contingent on governance improvements. A Fund spokesperson said on Friday that those discussions were "on hold pending political stabilisation" without specifying what stabilisation conditions would need to be met.

The natural gas development off Mozambique's northern coast — one of the largest liquefied natural gas discoveries in the world, whose development by TotalEnergies and Eni had been expected to transform Mozambique's economic trajectory — remains suspended. TotalEnergies declared force majeure on its Mozambique LNG project in 2021 following the insurgency's attack on the town of Palma and has not resumed construction, though it has conducted periodic security assessments. The political crisis has not improved the investment climate considerations that would need to be satisfied before a resumption decision could be made.

António Sérgio Chenene, secretary-general of the Mozambican civil society network JOINT, said on Friday that the international community's response to the crisis had been "insufficient in urgency and inadequate in honesty." He argued that SADC's refusal to question the election results more directly reflected member states' own institutional interests in protecting incumbent governments from challenges based on electoral fraud rather than a genuine assessment of Mozambican circumstances. "Every government in SADC is run by a party that has never lost power," he said. "They are not neutral mediators. They are an association of incumbents."

Whether the mediation process can produce an outcome that either resolves the political impasse or reduces the violence to a level compatible with economic and social functioning is a question that the events of the past four months give little basis for answering optimistically.

In Maputo's markets and minibus taxi ranks, where the immediate realities of economic disruption and physical danger intersect with political conviction and fear, the conversation on Friday moved between anger, exhaustion, and a stubborn refusal — visible in the continued compliance with strike calls that impose direct personal economic cost — to accept an outcome that a significant portion of the population regards as simply, factually wrong.

"We know what we saw," said one market vendor in Maputo's Xipamanine market, who declined to give her name. "We know how we voted. Those numbers they announced are not our votes."
