# Peru's Lithium Boom Triggers Land Rights Crisis as Indigenous Communities Block Mining Access Routes

**LIMA, Feb. 21** — Peru's government declared a state of emergency in three provinces of the Puno region in the country's high-altitude southeastern altiplano on Friday after indigenous Aymara communities blockaded the principal access routes to what geologists have described as one of the most significant lithium brine deposits identified anywhere in South America in the past decade, bringing to a halt the preliminary exploration operations of a joint venture between a Canadian mining company and Peru's state investment promotion agency and threatening to derail government plans to position Peru as a major supplier in the global critical minerals supply chain at precisely the moment when international demand for battery-grade lithium has reached levels that mining executives describe as historically unprecedented.

The blockades, which began twelve days ago and have progressively tightened to the point where the joint venture's exploration camp has been without resupply for six days, are the culmination of eighteen months of escalating dispute between the communities of the Huancané and Moho provinces and the government over what community leaders describe as the complete absence of genuine prior consultation before the lithium exploration concession was granted, the failure to disclose the full extent of planned operations to affected populations, and the specific threat that large-scale lithium brine extraction would pose to the underground aquifer systems and wetland ecosystems of the altiplano that the Aymara communities depend upon for agriculture, livestock, and the freshwater sources that are their only viable supply at altitudes above 3,800 metres where no alternative water infrastructure exists.

"They gave away our water without asking us," said Rufino Chambi Quispe, president of the Huancané Provincial Peasant Community Federation and the principal negotiator for the blocking communities, reached by telephone on Friday. "Not our minerals. Our water. Because you cannot take the lithium from a brine deposit without taking the water. They did not explain that to us. They did not explain anything."

The state of emergency, declared by President Dina Boluarte's cabinet on Friday morning and authorising the deployment of police and military units to the region, drew immediate condemnation from indigenous rights organisations, opposition legislators, and the UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, Graciela Flores Huerta, who issued a statement on Friday calling the declaration "a disproportionate response to the legitimate exercise of rights guaranteed under ILO Convention 169 and the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, both of which Peru has ratified and both of which require free, prior, and informed consent from indigenous communities before extractive operations affecting their territories may proceed."

Peru's ratification of ILO Convention 169 and its passage of a prior consultation law in 2011 have not prevented repeated conflicts between the state, mining and energy companies, and indigenous and rural communities across the country's resource-rich highlands and Amazon regions, a pattern that analysts of Peruvian political economy attribute to a systematic gap between the formal requirements of consultation law and the operational reality of concession-granting processes that have continued to prioritise investment promotion over substantive community engagement. The social conflict monitoring unit of the Ombudsman's office documented 192 active social conflicts in Peru in its most recent monthly report, of which 67 percent were classified as socio-environmental in nature and the majority of which involved mining or hydrocarbon operations.

The Canadian company, Vancouver-registered Andean Critical Minerals Corporation, whose shares rose sharply on the Toronto Stock Exchange when the Puno deposit's potential was announced in a resource estimate published last September and which have fallen 34 percent since the blockades began, issued a statement on Friday expressing willingness to engage in "constructive and comprehensive dialogue" with affected communities and calling on the government to "create the conditions for that dialogue to occur." The statement did not address the communities' specific allegation that the consultation process conducted before the concession was granted had been procedurally deficient, a claim that the company's Peruvian legal advisers have previously contested.

Peru's Energy and Mines Ministry argued on Friday that the prior consultation process conducted in 2022 had complied fully with national law and had involved three formally convened dialogue sessions with community representatives. A senior ministry official, speaking without authorisation, acknowledged privately that attendance at two of those three sessions had been "lower than ideal" and that the technical documentation provided to community representatives had not been available in Aymara — the primary language of the affected population — at the time of the consultations. "In retrospect there are things we would do differently," the official said. "That does not mean the process was invalid."

The lithium deposit at the centre of the dispute, located in the Corani and Putina subbasins at altitudes between 3,900 and 4,200 metres, was estimated in Andean Critical Minerals' September resource statement to contain lithium carbonate equivalent resources of approximately 4.1 million tonnes — a figure that, if confirmed in subsequent feasibility studies, would place it among the ten largest known lithium deposits in South America, a continent that holds approximately 60 percent of the world's identified lithium reserves. Peru, which has substantial copper and gold mining industries but has not previously been a significant lithium producer, has watched the rapid emergence of Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina as lithium suppliers with a mixture of competitive anxiety and strategic ambition.

The Boluarte government has identified critical minerals, and lithium in particular, as a central element of its economic development strategy for the highland south, a region that is simultaneously among Peru's most resource-rich and most economically marginalised and that has been the site of repeated and sometimes deadly social conflicts over extractive industry in recent years. The government's narrative frames lithium development as an opportunity for the Puno region's communities to benefit from the global clean energy transition — an argument that community leaders on Friday described as ironic given that the transition's demands for battery materials may come at the direct cost of the water and ecosystems on which those same communities' livelihoods depend.

"They tell us this is for the green future," said Chambi Quispe. "But our future is here, in this land, with this water. If the water is gone there is no future for us, green or otherwise."

The geopolitics of critical mineral supply chains add an international dimension to what might otherwise be a domestic land rights dispute. The United States, which has designated lithium a critical mineral essential to national security and is actively seeking to develop supply chains that reduce dependence on Chinese processing capacity — China currently refines approximately 60 percent of the world's lithium regardless of where it is mined — has been in discussion with the Peruvian government about a minerals partnership framework that would include Peruvian lithium among its priority targets. A State Department official, speaking informally on Friday, said Washington was "following the Puno situation closely" but declined to characterise whether US interests in the deposit's development affected its assessment of the community rights dimensions of the dispute.

China's state-owned Ganfeng Lithium, the world's largest lithium producer, was reported by Peruvian financial media in December to have held preliminary conversations with Andean Critical Minerals about a potential offtake agreement, though neither company has confirmed those reports. If accurate, the involvement of a Chinese state enterprise in the deposit's eventual development would add a layer of geopolitical sensitivity to investment decisions that the Peruvian government was already navigating with considerable difficulty.

The state of emergency declared on Friday authorises the deployment of security forces but does not, under Peruvian law, suspend the constitutional protections for peaceful assembly and protest that the blockading communities are invoking as the legal basis for their action. Previous states of emergency in Peruvian social conflicts have produced violent confrontations that generated lasting political damage, most notably the 2009 Bagua massacre in which clashes between security forces and Amazonian indigenous protesters over hydrocarbon concessions killed at least 33 people and triggered the resignation of the prime minister.

The Ombudsman's office, which has deployed a team to Puno and has been serving as an informal mediator between the communities and the government, urged on Friday that security forces not be used to forcibly clear the blockades and called for an immediate suspension of exploration activities as a confidence-building measure to create conditions for genuine dialogue. "The use of force will not resolve this conflict," the Ombudsman said in a statement. "It will deepen it and extend it and add to a list of grievances that is already long enough."

Whether the Boluarte government, whose approval ratings in the Puno region hover in the single digits following the deadly repression of protests there in late 2022 that killed more than a dozen people, possesses the political credibility with affected communities to negotiate a way through the crisis is a question that observers in Lima and in Puno answered on Friday with consistent pessimism.

A resolution, if one comes, will require more than a state of emergency. It will require a government willing to accept that the consultation process it conducted was inadequate, a company willing to substantially redesign its operational approach, and communities willing to engage with an extractive proposition that their direct experience gives them every reason to distrust. None of those conditions appeared to be in place on Friday afternoon.
