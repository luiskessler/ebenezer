# Zambia's Copper Expansion Programme Stalls as Power Crisis Deepens and Smelter Closures Threaten Economic Recovery

**LUSAKA, Feb. 21** — Zambia's government declared a national energy emergency on Friday after the country's two largest copper smelters announced temporary production suspensions citing electricity supply failures that had reduced available power to industrial consumers to less than 40 percent of contracted capacity for 23 consecutive days, threatening an expansion programme that the government of President Hakainde Hichilema had positioned as the centrepiece of Zambia's emergence from the sovereign debt default it completed restructuring in 2023, and confronting international investors who had committed more than $2 billion in new copper sector capital over the past eighteen months with operating conditions that several described on Friday as incompatible with the business cases on which their investment decisions had been made.

The suspensions, announced within hours of each other on Thursday evening by First Quantum Minerals' Kansanshi smelter in North-Western Province and the Mopani Copper Mines smelter in the Copperbelt city of Mufulira — two facilities that together account for approximately 35 percent of Zambia's total refined copper output — came after ZESCO, the state electricity utility, issued force majeure notifications to industrial customers on Wednesday citing what it described as "an unprecedented hydrological emergency" that had reduced generation at the Kariba Dam and the Kafue Gorge hydroelectric facilities to levels insufficient to meet both domestic and industrial demand simultaneously.

The hydrological emergency is real and its dimensions are severe. The Kariba reservoir, shared between Zambia and Zimbabwe and whose water level determines generation capacity at the Kariba North Bank power station that provides approximately a quarter of Zambia's electricity, reached 8.3 percent of full capacity on Friday — its lowest recorded level for this point in the calendar year — after two consecutive years of below-average rainfall in the Zambezi catchment that climate scientists attribute to the combined effects of El Niño conditions and the longer-term drying trend that climate models project for southern Africa under current emissions trajectories.

"We are not dealing with a temporary drought," said Dr. Brigadier Libanda, a senior meteorologist at the Zambia Meteorological Department, speaking to journalists in Lusaka on Friday. "The Zambezi basin has experienced rainfall deficits in six of the past eight years. The Kariba reservoir has not returned to full capacity since 2018. This is the new climatic reality for Zambia's hydropower system, and it demands a structural response that goes beyond emergency measures."

The structural response has been delayed by a combination of financing constraints, procurement complications, and what independent energy analysts described on Friday as strategic errors in Zambia's power sector investment planning that prioritised incremental hydropower expansion over the diversification into solar and other renewable sources that the country's solar irradiation profile would support and that would be less vulnerable to the rainfall variability now threatening the hydropower-dependent system.

Zambia receives among the highest solar irradiation levels in sub-Saharan Africa, and its electricity generation mix remains more than 85 percent hydropower-dependent — a figure whose vulnerability has been demonstrated repeatedly in recent years but that has changed only marginally despite successive government commitments to diversification. Independent power producers have signed solar generation agreements with ZESCO covering approximately 900 megawatts of new capacity, but grid connection delays and ZESCO's own financial constraints — the utility carries approximately $2.4 billion in debt and has been unable to raise tariffs to cost-reflective levels for political reasons — have prevented most of those agreements from reaching commercial operation.

The copper sector's exposure to the power crisis carries consequences that extend well beyond Zambia's borders. The country is the world's eighth-largest copper producer and Africa's second-largest, and copper — essential for electrical wiring, electric vehicle motors, renewable energy infrastructure, and the full range of electrification technologies underpinning the global clean energy transition — is experiencing a demand surge whose long-term trajectory most commodity analysts describe as structurally positive regardless of short-term price volatility. The International Energy Agency projected last year that global copper demand would nearly double by 2040 under its stated policies scenario, a projection that has made Zambia's copper expansion one of the most closely watched investment stories in African mining.

Hichilema's government, which came to power in 2021 having made copper sector expansion and economic recovery its primary programmatic commitment, completed Zambia's debt restructuring — finalised with all bilateral and commercial creditors by mid-2023 after years of negotiations — and has since attracted investment commitments from First Quantum, Vedanta Resources, and several Chinese mining companies whose combined capital expenditure plans represent the most significant inflow of mining investment Zambia has received since the early 2000s commodity boom. The power crisis threatens to convert that investment momentum into a liability rather than an asset if smelter suspensions extend beyond the short term.

Energy Minister Peter Kapala announced on Friday a package of emergency measures that included the authorisation of emergency diesel generation procurement — an expensive stopgap whose cost the ministry estimated at $4 million per week — priority power allocation protocols that would ensure industrial customers received a minimum of 60 percent of contracted capacity within ten days, and the expedited approval of three solar independent power producer projects whose grid connection had been delayed by regulatory processes that the minister acknowledged had been "insufficiently prioritised."

The announcement was welcomed cautiously by mining sector representatives but described as insufficient by several. A spokesperson for First Quantum said the company was "encouraged by the government's commitment" but noted that the 60 percent guaranteed minimum capacity was below the threshold required for full smelter operation and that diesel generation costs, if passed through to industrial consumers, would add per-tonne production costs that would affect the economics of several marginal operations.

Vedanta, whose Konkola Copper Mines returned to Zambian operation in 2021 after a court-supervised recovery from a disputed government takeover attempt under the previous Lungu administration, has invested approximately $400 million in Copperbelt infrastructure since its return and is in the process of developing a new underground mining section whose production timeline is now subject to revision given the power situation. A Vedanta spokesperson said the company was in "close dialogue" with ZESCO and the government and had not yet made decisions about its expansion timeline.

The World Bank, whose $1.5 billion development policy programme for Zambia approved in 2023 included specific energy sector reform conditionalities — including ZESCO tariff adjustment and independent power producer facilitation — issued a statement on Friday expressing concern about the power crisis and urging "accelerated implementation of the energy sector reform commitments that are essential to Zambia's long-term economic resilience." The statement's reference to commitments already made but not fully implemented was read by Zambian economists as a pointed reminder that the current crisis was partly the consequence of reform delays.

The Democratic Republic of Congo, whose mining sector in Katanga province shares infrastructure, supply chain connections, and some investor exposure with Zambia's Copperbelt, watched the power crisis with concern about potential contagion effects on its own electricity situation, which depends partly on Zambian grid interconnection. A DRC energy ministry official, reached by telephone in Kinshasa on Friday, said the country was "monitoring the situation" and had activated contingency arrangements for its Katanga industrial consumers.

The Zimbabwe connection adds a bilateral dimension whose management requires diplomatic as well as technical coordination. Kariba is a shared facility, and Zimbabwe's own power shortage — the country has experienced severe load shedding for years due to a combination of Kariba's low water levels and the deterioration of its Hwange coal-fired power stations — means there is limited scope for the bilateral water management flexibility that might otherwise allow one country to temporarily prioritise the other's generation needs. Talks between Zambian and Zimbabwean water and energy ministers are scheduled for Monday in Victoria Falls to discuss the Kariba management situation.

The human consequences of the power crisis extend well beyond the mining sector. Zambia's urban residential consumers have been experiencing load shedding of between eight and fourteen hours daily for the past three weeks, a disruption that has affected food storage, water pumping, healthcare facility operations, and the productive capacity of small businesses throughout the Copperbelt and Lusaka. In Kitwe and Ndola, the Copperbelt's principal cities, residents have reported that hospital generators have operated beyond their designed continuous-use capacity and that fuel for those generators has been intermittently unavailable.

"The mining company suspensions are the story that gets international attention," said Grieve Chelwa, a Zambian economist at the New School for Social Research in New York, speaking by telephone on Friday. "The story that does not get the same attention is what fourteen hours without electricity means for a family trying to keep food safe, for a clinic trying to maintain vaccine cold chains, for a small business trying to operate. The power crisis is a humanitarian crisis that happens to have an industrial dimension, not an industrial crisis that incidentally affects households."

Whether the emergency measures announced Friday will stabilise the situation sufficiently to allow smelter operations to resume within the week-to-ten-day timeframe that mining companies said was approximately their operational tolerance before suspension costs became significantly more difficult to reverse, depends on ZESCO's capacity to procure and deploy diesel generation at the speed the minister projected — a capacity whose track record gives independent observers reasons for qualified rather than confident optimism.

The Zambia Meteorological Department's forecast for the southern hemisphere's autumn rainfall season, released on Thursday, projected a further 15 to 20 percent deficit in Zambezi catchment rainfall through April, offering no near-term relief to reservoir levels from natural inflows.

The energy emergency declaration gives the government additional procurement and contracting flexibility under Zambian law, bypassing some of the competitive tendering requirements that have historically slowed emergency infrastructure procurement. Whether that flexibility translates into the speed the crisis requires will be apparent within days.
